# RMC Software Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation site for the RMC suite of tools, developed and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Risk Management Center (RMC). The site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), customized to align with USACE branding.

The project includes:

- User guides and technical manuals for RMC software tools
- Detailed component-level documentation (React-based)
- Tables, figures, citations, equations, and glossary support
- Versioned documentation management
- Built-in navigation, search, and dark mode

The project is organized to support easy contribution, internal consistency, and extensibility across future RMC documentation needs.

For development standards, file structure, custom components, and styling conventions, please refer to the internal [Documentation Guide](https://usace-rmc.github.io/RMC-Software-Documentation/docs/documentation-guide/introduction/)

The guide includes:

- How to write and structure MDX content
- How to use and customize React components
- Tailwind utility conventions and shared styles
- Table formatting and counter file integration
- Versioning strategy and linking guidelines
