Similar to the Expected Annual tab, the Flood Risk\r\ntab provides a visual representation of the contribution of levee risk compared to non-breach risk for the overall flood risk behind the levee. The\r\nresults are displayed on the f-N chart. Flood risk expected annual consequence and APF is the sum of levee risk and non-breach risk. Average\r\nconsequence (life loss or damage) is the expected annual consequence divided by APF."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.A,{figKey:"figure-208",src:"figures\\web-applications\\lst\\users-guide\\v1.0\\figures\\figure208.png",alt:"LST Results Module \u2013 Flood Risk",caption:"LST Results Module \u2013 Flood Risk"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(r.A,{})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(f,{...e})}):f(e)}},53327:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>l});var i=n(96540),o=n(92559),s=n(56347),r=n(33762),a=n(74848);const l=()=>{const[e,t]=(0,i.useState)([]),n=(0,s.zy)().pathname,l=r.N?(0,r.N)():null,u=`${n.replace(/^\/RMC-Software-Documentation\/docs\//,"/RMC-Software-Documentation/bibliographies/").replace(/\/[^/]*$/,"")}/bib.json`,c=l?`/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/${l}.json`:null,d=(0,o.bx)(n);if((0,i.useEffect)(()=>{let e=!0;return(async()=>{if(c)if(d&&0!==d.length)try{const[n,i]=await Promise.all([fetch(u),fetch(c)]),o=await n.json(),s=await i.json(),r=d.map(e=>{const t=o.find(t=>t.citationKey===e)||{},n=s?.citations?.[e];return n?{...t,citationKey:e,number:n.citationNumber}:null}).filter(Boolean).sort((e,t)=>e.number-t.number);e&&t(r)}catch(n){console.error("Error fetching citations or counters:",n)}else e&&t([])})(),()=>{e=!1}},[u,c,n,d]),0===e.length)return null;const h=e=>{const{author:t,year:n,title:i,journal:o,booktitle:s,report:r,manual:l,institution:u,organization:c,location:d,address:h,volume:p,edition:f,pages:m,doi:b,url:g,publisher:v,entryType:x}=e;return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(j=t,j?Array.isArray(j)?j.length>3?`${j[0]}, et al.`:3===j.length?`${j[0]}, ${j[1]}, and ${j[2]}`:2===j.length?`${j[0]} and ${j[1]}`:j[0]:j:""),t&&i&&", ",(y=i,w=x,"inproceedings"===w?`"${y}",`:(0,a.jsx)("i",{children:`${y},`})),p&&` Vol. ${p}, `,f&&` ${f} ed.,`,o&&(0,a.jsxs)("em",{children:[" ",o,","]}),s&&` ${s}, `,(d||h)&&` ${d||h}:`,c&&` ${c},`,m&&` pp. ${m}, `,v&&` ${v}, `,u&&` ${u}, `,r&&` ${r}, `,l&&` ${l}, `,n&&` ${n}.`,b&&(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[" ","doi:"," ",(0,a.jsx)("a",{href:`https://doi.org/${b}`,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",className:"no-underline text-ifm-link hover:text-ifm-link-hover hover:underline",children:b})]}),g&&(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[" ","Available:"," ",(0,a.jsx)("a",{href:g,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",className:"no-underline text-ifm-link hover:text-ifm-link-hover hover:underline",children:g})]})]});var y,w,j};return(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"mt-20 pt-2 border-t border-color",children:(0,a.jsx)("ol",{className:"list-none pl-0 mt-5",children:e.map(e=>(0,a.jsxs)("li",{value:e.number,id:`footnote-${e.citationKey}`,className:"flex items-start mb-2.5",children:[(0,a.jsxs)("span",{className:"min-w-[40px] flex-shrink-0",children:["[",e.number,"]"]}),(0,a.jsx)("span",{className:"block",children:h(e)})]},e.citationKey))})})}},92559:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Ay:()=>m,bx:()=>f});var i=n(56347),o=n(96540),s=n(33762),r=n(74848);const a=new Map,l=new Set,u=new Map,c=Object.freeze([]);function d(e,t){if(!t)return;const n=a.get(e);u.set(e,n&&n.size?Array.from(n):c),l.forEach(e=>e())}function h(e){return l.add(e),()=>l.delete(e)}function p(){return c}function f(e){return(0,o.useSyncExternalStore)(h,()=>function(e){return u.has(e)||u.set(e,c),u.get(e)}(e),p)}const m=({citationKey:e})=>{const[t,n]=(0,o.useState)("?"),[l,u]=(0,o.useState)(null),c=(0,i.zy)().pathname,h=s.N?(0,s.N)():null,p=`${c.replace(/^\/RMC-Software-Documentation\/docs\//,"/RMC-Software-Documentation/bibliographies/").replace(/\/[^/]*$/,"")}/bib.json`,f=h?`/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/${h}.json`:null;return(0,o.useEffect)(()=>{let t=!0;return(async()=>{if(f&&e)try{const i=await fetch(f),o=await i.json(),s=o?.citations?.[e];s&&t&&n(s.citationNumber)}catch(i){console.error("Error fetching counters file:",i)}})(),()=>{t=!1}},[e,f]),(0,o.useEffect)(()=>{let t=!0;return(async()=>{if(p&&e)try{const n=await fetch(p),i=(await n.json()).find(t=>t.citationKey===e);i&&t&&u(i)}catch(n){console.error("Error fetching bibliography:",n)}})(),()=>{t=!1}},[e,p]),(0,o.useEffect)(()=>{if(e)return function(e,t){if(!e||!t)return;a.has(e)||a.set(e,new Set);const n=a.get(e),i=n.size;n.add(t),d(e,n.size!==i)}(c,e),()=>function(e,t){if(!e||!t)return;const n=a.get(e);if(!n)return;const i=n.size;d(e,n.delete(t)&&n.size!==i)}(c,e)},[c,e]),(0,r.jsx)("span",{className:"font-usace text-[inherit]",children:(0,r.jsxs)("a",{href:`#footnote-${e}`,className:"text-ifm-link no-underline hover:text-ifm-link-hover",children:["[",t,"]"]})})}}}]);
