# Static Folder

The `static/` folder contains all static files used by the RMC Software Documentation project. These files are served directly by Docusaurus
and are accessible via URLs relative to the site root. The folder is organized into several subfolders to support bibliographies, counters,
figures, fonts, images, and versioning.

---

## Bibliographies

Contains JSON files used by the `<Citation>`, `<CitationFootnote>`, and `<Bibliography>` React components to create reference lists for each document.
Each JSON file should share the same name: `bib.json`.

:::warning

**These files must be manually generated prior to building the documentation cite.**

:::

The folder strucutre should mirror that of the `docs/` folder:

```
static/
    └── bibliographies/
        └── desktop-applications/
            └── rmc-totalrisk/
                └── users-guide/
                    └── v1.0/
                        ├── bib.json
        └── toolbox-technical-manuals/
            └── internal-erosion-suite/
                └── backward-erosion-piping-progression/
                    └── v1.0/
                        ├── bib.json
```

Each bibliography file should contain all referenced used in the corresponding document, with all categories of references included to produce citations
using the [IEEE style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OalFYqVfxKKMelF79U3B93SjmIEiTnJC12wPJrKeSDM/edit?tab=t.0).

### Format

Each bibliography file should be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "citationKey": "Beard1960",
    "entryType": "article",
    "author": ["L. R. Beard"],
    "year": 1960,
    "title": "Probability Estimates Based on Small Normal-Distribution Samples",
    "journal": "Journal of Geophysical Research"
  },
  {
    "citationKey": "BobeeAshkar1991",
    "entryType": "book",
    "author": ["B. Bobee", "F. Ashkar"],
    "year": 1991,
    "title": "The Gamma Family and Derived Distributions Applied in Hydrology",
    "address": "Littleton, CO",
    "institution": "Water Resources Publications"
  },
  {
    "citationKey": "Cohn2013",
    "entryType": "article",
    "author": [
      "T. A. Cohn",
      "J. F. England",
      "C. E. Berenbrock",
      "R. R. Mason",
      "J. R. Stedinger",
      "J. R. Lamontagne"
    ],
    "year": 2013,
    "title": "A generalized Grubbs-Beck test statistic for detecting multiple potentially influential low outliers in flood series",
    "journal": "Water Resources Research",
    "volume": "49",
    "issue": "8",
    "pages": "5047-5058"
  },
]
```

## Counters

Contains JSON files created by the `counters.js` script for each report.

:::info

**This folder is ignored by git and will not be committed to the repository.**

:::

These files store sequential numbering and metadata for figures, tables, equations, and citations used in the documentation. Each
report ID has its own counters JSON file.

---

## Figures

Repository of figure images used within the document.

:::warning

**Figures must be added to this folder prior to building the documentation cite.**

:::

The folder structure should mirror that of the `docs/` folder:

```
static/
    └── figures/
        └── desktop-applications/
            └── rmc-totalrisk/
                └── users-guide/
                    └── v1.0/
                        ├── figure1.png
                        ├── figure2.png
        └── toolbox-technical-manuals/
            └── internal-erosion-suite/
                └── backward-erosion-piping-progression/
                    └── v1.0/
                        ├── figure1.png
                        ├── figure2.png
```

- File names for figure images can be assigned as needed, but should be referenced by `Figure` components in `.mdx` files using an
  intuitive naming convention.

---

## Fonts

Contains downloaded font files for use with custom CSS.

---

## Img

Contains static images used within website pages (e.g., logos, icons, banners).

---

## Versions

Contains JSON files produced by the `versions.js` script for version management and Algolia search:

- `algoliaCrawlerVersions.json`: Contains start URLs and discovery patterns for Algolia's documentation crawler.
- `latestVersions.json`: Lists the latest version for each report in the `docs/` folder.
- `versionList.json`: Lists all available versions for each report in the `docs/` folder.
