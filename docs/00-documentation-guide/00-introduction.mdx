## Key Concepts to Understand

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

### Docusaurus

**Docusaurus** is a modern static website generator built on React. It takes your Markdown/MDX files and converts them into a fast, user-friendly documentation website with:

- Automatic navigation sidebar
- Search functionality
- Version management
- Dark mode support
- Mobile responsiveness

**What you need to know:** Docusaurus handles the technical website stuff automatically. You focus on writing content.

### MDX (Markdown + JSX)

**MDX** is a file format that combines:

- **Markdown** - Simple text formatting syntax (headings, lists, bold, italic, etc.)
- **JSX** - React component syntax that lets you insert interactive elements

**Example:**

```mdx
## This is a Markdown heading

This is regular text with **bold** and _italic_ formatting.

<Figure figureKey="fig-1" src="/figures/my-diagram.png" caption="This is a React component embedded in Markdown" />
```

**What you need to know:** Write most of your content in Markdown, and use JSX components for figures, tables, and special formatting.

### React Components

**React components** are reusable UI elements that you can insert into your MDX files. They handle complex layouts and automatic numbering.

**Examples:**

- `<Figure>` - Numbered figure with caption and auto-generated figure number
- `<TableVertical>` - Multi-column table with complex spanning
- `<Equation>` - Numbered mathematical equation with LaTeX formatting
- `<Citation>` - Inline citation reference linked to bibliography

**What you need to know:** You don't need to understand how components work internally. Just learn the syntax to use them (covered in this guide).

### Version Control with Git

**Git** is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time. **GitHub** is a web platform for hosting Git repositories.

**What you need to know:**

- Git keeps a history of all changes
- You can always revert if something breaks
- Multiple people can work simultaneously without conflicts
- GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly interface

## Common Contribution Workflows

### Workflow 1: Convert Existing Word Document

**Use case:** You have an existing RMC document in Word format that needs to be converted to MDX.

**Steps:**

1. Place Word document in `static/source-documents/`
2. Run DOCX converter script to generate MDX files
3. Review and refine generated MDX files
4. Add generated files to appropriate `docs/` folder
5. Test locally with `npm start`
6. Commit changes to Git

**Typical time:** 1-3 hours depending on document complexity

---

### Workflow 2: Create New Documentation from Scratch

**Use case:** You're creating brand new documentation for software or a technical manual.

**Steps:**

1. Determine folder location in `docs/` (hub → sub-hub → document → version)
2. Create version folder (e.g., `v1.0/`)
3. Create required files: `00-document-info.mdx`, `00-version-history.mdx`
4. Create chapter files: `01-preface.mdx`, `02-methodology.mdx`, etc.
5. Add images to matching folder in `static/figures/`
6. Create `bib.json` in `static/bibliographies/` if using citations
7. Test locally with `npm start`
8. Commit changes to Git

**Typical time:** Varies by document length and complexity

---

### Workflow 3: Update Existing Documentation

**Use case:** You need to update an existing document for a new software version or to correct errors.

**For minor edits (typos, small clarifications):**

1. Edit the existing version's MDX files directly
2. Test locally
3. Commit changes

**For major updates (new features, substantial changes):**

1. Create new version folder (e.g., `v1.1/`)
2. Copy all files from previous version
3. Make updates to the new version
4. Add new images to corresponding `static/figures/` version folder
5. Update `bib.json` if needed
6. Test locally
7. Commit changes

**Typical time:** 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on scope

---

## Tools You'll Use

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Your primary text editor for writing MDX files.

**Key features:**

- Syntax highlighting for Markdown and JSX
- Built-in terminal for running commands
- Extensions for improved MDX support
- Git integration

### Command Line / Terminal

Used to run npm commands like `npm start` and `npm build`.

**Don't worry!** You only need to know a handful of commands (all covered in this guide).

### Node.js & npm

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime that powers Docusaurus
- **npm** - Package manager that installs project dependencies

**What you need to know:** Run `npm install` once during setup, then use `npm start` to run the site locally.

### Git & GitHub Desktop

- **Git** - Tracks changes to your files
- **GitHub Desktop** - User-friendly interface for Git (no command line needed)

**What you need to know:** Use GitHub Desktop to commit changes and sync with the repository.

## Documentation Philosophy

Good documentation should be:

✅ **Clear** - Easy to understand for the intended audience  
✅ **Accurate** - Technically correct and up to date  
✅ **Complete** - Covers all necessary topics without gaps  
✅ **Consistent** - Follows established conventions and style  
✅ **Accessible** - Usable by people with disabilities  
✅ **Maintainable** - Easy to update and extend

This guide helps you create documentation that meets these standards.
