# React Components

## What is React?

**React** is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where a dynamic
and responsive experience is important. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render based on changing data.

React uses a **component-based architecture**, where the UI is broken into small, self-contained pieces called components. Each component manages its own
state and renders based on that state and its inputs (called props). React uses a **virtual DOM** - an in-memory representation of the real DOM - to optimize
updates. When data changes, React efficiently computes the minimal set of changes and applies them to the actual DOM, improving performance and responsiveness.

## Why This Project Uses React

This documentation site uses React because:

- **Component Reusability**: Custom components like `<Figure>`, `<TableVertical>`, and `<Citation>` allow for consistent formatting and easy reuse across multiple documents.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: React enables conditional rendering and logic-based content, which is valuable for development and component-driven pages.
- **Docusaurus Integration**: Docusaurus is built on React, so using React components fits naturally with the framework and extends its capabilities.

By leveraging React, the documentation becomes more modular, maintainable, and interactive, aligning with modern web development standards.

## React Components in This Project

This project includes several custom React components that enhance the documentation experience. These components are designed to be reusable and provide
consistent formatting across different pages. The following sections describe the key components available to developers.

React components should not be altered, removed, or added to this project. To request changes, additions, or improvements, please contact a site administrator.

### Bibliography

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<Bibliography>` component is a dynamic React component used to render a properly ordered and formatted list of citations within a documentation page.
It automatically loads citation metadata from a `bib.json` file and aligns each entry to the citation numbers defined in the corresponding `counters.json` file.

This component is intended for reports and technical documentation where references must be accurate, consistent, and easily maintained across versions.

**Key functionality includes:**

- Automatically determines the bibliography file path based on the current page URL and active `reportId` from context.
- Loads two JSON files:
  - `bib.json` – Contains full citation metadata.
  - `counters/{reportId}.json` – Maps `citationKey`s to citation numbers.
- Merges and sorts citations in proper numerical order (`[1]`, `[2]`, etc.).
- Formats author lists based on count:
  - 1 author: `Author A`
  - 2 authors: `Author A and Author B`
  - 3 authors: `Author A, Author B, and Author C`
  - > 3 authors: `Author A, et al.`
- Outputs an ordered list (`<ol>`) of styled citations:
  - Italicizes titles
  - Links DOIs and URLs
  - Handles fields like `journal`, `volume`, `pages`, `organization`, `institution`, and more

:::tip
Store all bibliography files in `/static/bibliographies/` and follow the name convention laid out in [Static Folder](./07-static-folder.mdx) to allow the
component to resolve them automatically.

#### Props

The component does **not accept any props**. Instead, it uses two React Context hooks internally:

| Source          | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useLocation()` | Extracts the current documentation path to construct the `bib.json` file path |
| `useReportId()` | Resolves the active `reportId` to locate the corresponding `counters.json`    |

#### Example Usage

To render a bibliography section in a documentation page, simply import and place the component in your References page:

```jsx
import Bibliography from '@site/src/components/Bibliography';

<Bibliography />

```
