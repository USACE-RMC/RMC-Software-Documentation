# React Components

## What is React?

**React** is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where a dynamic
and responsive experience is important. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render based on changing data.

React uses a **component-based architecture**, where the UI is broken into small, self-contained pieces called components. Each component manages its own
state and renders based on that state and its inputs (called props). React uses a **virtual DOM** - an in-memory representation of the real DOM - to optimize
updates. When data changes, React efficiently computes the minimal set of changes and applies them to the actual DOM, improving performance and responsiveness.

## Why This Project Uses React

This documentation site uses React because:

- **Component Reusability**: Custom components like `<Figure>`, `<TableVertical>`, and `<Citation>` allow for consistent formatting and easy reuse across multiple documents.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: React enables conditional rendering and logic-based content, which is valuable for development and component-driven pages.
- **Docusaurus Integration**: Docusaurus is built on React, so using React components fits naturally with the framework and extends its capabilities.

By leveraging React, the documentation becomes more modular, maintainable, and interactive, aligning with modern web development standards.

## React Components in This Project

This project includes several custom React components that enhance the documentation experience. These components are designed to be reusable and provide
consistent formatting across different pages. The following sections describe the key components available to developers.

:::danger NOTICE
React components should not be altered, removed, or added to this project. To request changes, additions, or improvements, please contact a site administrator.

### Bibliography

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<Bibliography>` component is a dynamic React component used to render a properly ordered and formatted list of citations within a documentation page.
It automatically loads citation metadata from a `bib.json` file and aligns each entry to the citation numbers defined in the corresponding `counters.json` file.

This component is intended for reports and technical documentation where references must be accurate, consistent, and easily maintained across versions.

**Functionality includes:**

- Automatically determines the bibliography file path based on the current page URL and active `reportId` from context.
- Loads two JSON files:
  - `bib.json` – Contains full citation metadata.
  - `counters/{reportId}.json` – Maps `citationKey`s to citation numbers.
- Merges and sorts citations in proper numerical order (`[1]`, `[2]`, etc.).
- Formats author lists based on count:
  - 1 author: `Author A`
  - 2 authors: `Author A and Author B`
  - 3 authors: `Author A, Author B, and Author C`
  - > 3 authors: `Author A, et al.`
- Outputs an ordered list (`<ol>`) of styled citations:
  - Italicizes titles
  - Links DOIs and URLs
  - Handles fields like `journal`, `volume`, `pages`, `organization`, `institution`, and more

:::tip
Store all bibliography files in `/static/bibliographies/` and follow the name convention laid out in [Static Folder](./07-static-folder.mdx) to allow the
component to resolve them automatically.
:::

#### Props

The component does **not accept any props**. Instead, it uses two React Context hooks internally:

| Source          | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useLocation()` | Extracts the current documentation path to construct the `bib.json` file path |
| `useReportId()` | Resolves the active `reportId` to locate the corresponding `counters.json`    |

#### Example Usage

To render a bibliography section in a documentation page, simply import and place the component in your References page:

```jsx
import Bibliography from '@site/src/components/Bibliography';

<Bibliography />

```

---

### Citation

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<Citation>` component is a lightweight inline React component that displays a numbered reference (e.g., `[3]`) tied to a citation entry in the page’s
bibliography. It ensures in-text references are dynamically synchronized with the citation order defined in the associated `counters.json` file.

**Functionality includes:**

- Automatically determines the citation number based on the current page’s path and the active `reportId` (via `useReportId()`).
- Loads the following resources:
  - `counters/{reportId}.json` – Maps `citationKey` to its assigned citation number
  - `bib.json` – Ensures the citation actually exists in the bibliography file
- Tracks which citations are used on each page via `getUsedCitations(pathname)`
- Renders a bracketed, clickable reference:
  - `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
  - Links to the matching entry in the `<Bibliography />` component (via `#footnote-{citationKey}`)

:::warning
The component assumes a one-to-one match between `citationKey` in `bib.json` and the `counters.json` file. If the key is missing from the counters file,
the reference will display as `[?]`.
:::

#### Props

| Prop          | Type   | Required | Description                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `citationKey` | string | ✅ Yes   | A unique key identifying the citation in both `bib.json` and `counters.json`. |

#### Example Usage

To insert an inline citation in your documentation, pass the `citationKey` to the component:

```jsx
import Citation from '@site/src/components/Citation';

This guidance is consistent with earlier findings <Citation citationKey="USACE2023c" />.
```

---

### CitationFootnote

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<CitationFootnote>` component renders a list of full citation footnotes at the bottom of a documentation page, based on which `<Citation />` references were used. It ensures that only citations actually referenced in the content are displayed, and that they appear in correct numerical order.

**Functionality includes:**

- Retrieves the current page path and active `reportId` to resolve:
  - `bib.json` – Contains full metadata for all potential citations
  - `counters/{reportId}.json` – Maps `citationKey`s to their assigned citation numbers
- Uses `getUsedCitations(pathname)` from the `<Citation />` module to determine which citation keys are used on the current page
- Sorts citations in ascending numerical order before rendering
- Formats author lists and fields such as:
  - `author`, `title`, `journal`, `volume`, `pages`, `publisher`, `organization`, `institution`, `doi`, `url`, etc.
- Wraps each entry in a list item with an ID like `#footnote-USACE2023c` for in-page linking from `<Citation />`

:::warning
The component will not render anything if no `<Citation />` components were used on the page. It only displays footnotes for referenced citations.
:::

#### Props

The component does **not accept any props**. Instead, it uses two React Context hooks internally:

| Source          | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useLocation()` | Extracts the current documentation path to construct the `bib.json` file path |
| `useReportId()` | Resolves the active `reportId` to locate the corresponding `counters.json`    |

#### Example Usage

Place `<CitationFootnote />` at the bottom of your `.mdx` file to display footnotes for all citations used in the page:

```jsx
import CitationFootnote from '@site/src/components/CitationFootnote';

<CitationFootnote />
```

---

### DocumentMetadata

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<DocumentMetadata>` component displays structured report metadata in a tabular format at the top or bottom of a documentation page. It is
designed to be used in the 00-document-info.mdx page to present key contextual information about the document—such as title, authorship, abstract,
and citation guidance—in a clean and consistent layout.

**Functionality includes:**

- Renders a table with defined metadata fields:
  - `Report Date`, `Type`, `Title`, `Subtitle`, `Author(s)`, `Abstract`, `Acknowledgements`, `Subject Terms`, `Responsible Person`,
    and `How to Cite This Document`
- Accepts metadata values as a single `metadata` object via props
- Handles arrays (`reportAuthors`, `reportSubjectTerms`) with custom formatting:
  - Authors are joined with `; `
  - Subject terms are joined with `, `
- Filters out any undefined or empty values to avoid displaying blank rows
- Renders text content as raw HTML using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to allow styled input (e.g., italics, superscripts)

:::warning
This component does not handle data fetching. Metadata must be passed as a complete object from the parent `.mdx` file or component.
:::

#### Props

| Prop       | Type   | Required | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metadata` | object | ✅ Yes   | An object containing key-value pairs for document metadata. See below. |

The metadata object should be formatted as frontMatter in the `.mdx` file, typically defined at the top of the document.

##### Expected Metadata Fields

| Key                       | Type              | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `reportDate`              | string            | Date the report was finalized                      |
| `reportType`              | string            | Document type (e.g., Technical Report, User Guide) |
| `reportTitle`             | string            | Main title of the document                         |
| `reportSubTitle`          | string (optional) | Optional subtitle or secondary title               |
| `reportAuthors`           | string \| array   | Author name(s), either as a single string or array |
| `reportAbstract`          | string            | Summary of the document’s content                  |
| `reportAcknowledgments`   | string (optional) | Credits for contributions or support               |

### Equation

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<Equation>` component renders LaTeX equations using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and optionally displays equation numbers based on the `equationKey`. It
supports both **inline** and **block-level** equations and ensures automatic numbering via a shared `counters.json` file scoped to the current `reportId`.

**Functionality includes:**

- Fetches the current `reportId` from context (`useReportId()`).
- Loads the corresponding counters file:
  - `/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/{reportId}.json`
- Matches the provided `equationKey` to retrieve the associated `equationNumber`.
- Displays the equation with or without a number depending on the `inline` prop.
- Renders equations using:
  - `<InlineMath />` from `react-katex` for inline formatting
  - `<BlockMath />` from `react-katex` for centered display with numbering

:::note
All equations are rendered with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), which supports a large subset of LaTeX. Be sure your expressions are KaTeX-compatible.
:::

#### Props

| Prop          | Type    | Required | Description                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `equationKey` | string  | ✅ Yes   | Unique key used to match the equation in `counters/{reportId}.json`.         |
| `equation`    | string  | ✅ Yes   | A valid LaTeX string representing the equation to be rendered.               |
| `inline`      | boolean | ❌ No    | If `true`, renders the equation inline (default: `false`, renders as block). |

:::caution
If `equationKey` is not found in the counters file, the equation will still render but without a number. Check the console for warnings if a number does not appear.
:::

#### Example Usage

To render a numbered equation in block format:

```jsx
import Equation from '@site/src/components/Equation';

<Equation
  equationKey="eqn_energy_balance"
  equation="E = mc^2"
/>
```

To render an inline equation without a number:

```jsx

<Equation
  equationKey="eqn_energy_balance"
  equation="E = mc^2"
  inline={true}>
/>
```

---

### EquationNoRef

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<EquationNoRef>` component renders LaTeX-based equations using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), but **without** reference numbers. It is ideal for displaying
supporting mathematical expressions where numbering is unnecessary, such as intermediate steps or formulas mentioned in passing.

**Functionality includes:**

- Uses the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) library to render mathematical content.
- Supports both inline and block display modes via the `inline` prop:
  - Inline mode renders within a line of text.
  - Block mode renders centered on its own line.
- Requires only the LaTeX equation string — no `reportId`, `equationKey`, or counters integration.

:::warning
This component is purely visual. It does **not** manage equation numbering, anchors, or references. Use `<Equation />` for numbered equations.
:::

#### Props

| Prop       | Type    | Required | Description                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `equation` | string  | ✅ Yes   | A LaTeX-compatible string representing the equation.                          |
| `inline`   | boolean | ❌ No    | If `true`, renders inline; if `false`, renders as a block. Default is `true`. |

:::info
This component does not fetch or display equation numbers. If you need an equation to be numbered and cross-referenced, use `<Equation />` instead.
:::

#### Example Usage

To render an inline equation:

```jsx
import EquationNoRef from '@site/src/components/EquationNoRef';

<EquationNoRef equation="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />
```

To render the same equation as a centered block:

```jsx
<EquationNoRef equation="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" inline={false} />
```

:::tip Best Practice
Use `<EquationNoRef>` for simple, unnumbered equations, when displaying intermediate steps in derivations, or short equations within text.
:::

---

### EquationReference

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<EquationReference>` component is used to **dynamically display a reference** to a numbered equation based on its `equationKey`. It
retrieves the equation number from a counters file scoped to the current `reportId` and renders a formatted string like `Equation 3`.

This is useful for referring to previously defined equations elsewhere in the documentation without hardcoding numbers.

**Functionality includes:**

- Retrieves the current `reportId` from context (`useReportId()`).
- Loads the appropriate `counters.json` file from:
  - `/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/{reportId}.json`
- Looks up the equation number corresponding to the provided `equationKey`.
- Renders a simple, styled text label like `Equation 5`.

:::note
This component does not render the equation itself—only a textual reference to its number. Use it in conjunction with `<Equation />` to
create cross-references.
:::

#### Props

| Prop          | Type   | Required | Description                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `equationKey` | string | ✅ Yes   | Unique identifier used to retrieve the equation number from the counters file. |

:::caution
If the `equationKey` is not found or the counters file cannot be loaded, the component will fallback to `Loading...`. Console warnings
will be shown to help with debugging.
:::

#### Example Usage

Use `<EquationReference />` inline to refer to a previously displayed equation:

```jsx
import EquationReference from '@site/src/components/EquationReference';

As shown in <EquationReference equationKey="eqn_energy_balance" />, energy is conserved...
```

---

### Figure

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<Figure>` component is used to embed images within documentation and automatically apply figure numbering using a centralized `counters.json` file.
It is ideal for technical reports that require consistently numbered figures across pages and references.

**Functionality includes:**

- Retrieves the current `reportId` from context using `useReportId()`
- Loads the associated `counters.json` file from:
  - `/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/{reportId}.json`
- Matches the provided `figKey` to the figure number in the counters file
- Renders:
  - An image using the `src` path
  - A caption with automatic numbering: `Figure 3: Caption text`

:::info
This component handles figure **numbering and display** in **block format**. To insert a figure inline with text, use the `<FigureInline />` component.

This component handles figure **numbering and display**. To insert an inline figure reference (e.g., "see Figure 3"), use the `<FigureReference />` component.
:::

#### Props

| Prop      | Type   | Required | Description                                                                |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `figKey`  | string | ✅ Yes   | Unique identifier for the figure in the counters file                      |
| `src`     | string | ✅ Yes   | Path to the image file relative to the `/RMC-Software-Documentation/` root |
| `alt`     | string | ✅ Yes   | Alternative text for the image (used for accessibility and SEO)            |
| `caption` | string | ✅ Yes   | Text that appears below the figure as its description                      |

:::caution
If `figKey` is not found or the counters file cannot be loaded, the component will fallback to `Loading...`. Console warnings will be shown to help with debugging.
:::

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

<Figure
  figKey="fig_infiltration_diagram"
  src="figures/infiltration-diagram.png"
  alt="Cross-sectional view of infiltration process"
  caption="Conceptual model illustrating infiltration through embankment materials."
/>

```

---

### FigureInline

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<FigureInline>` component is a simple, unnumbered image renderer used to display small images inline with surrounding content. It is best
suited for icons, schematic thumbnails, or other visuals that do **not** require figure numbers or captions.

**Functionality includes:**

- Constructs the image path by prepending `/RMC-Software-Documentation/` to the provided `src`.
- Applies inline styling via the `figure-inline` CSS class to ensure the image flows with surrounding text.
- Does **not** include captions, alt text, or numbering.

:::note
This component is strictly visual and is not included in the automatic figure numbering system. Use `<Figure />` if you need a captioned and
numbered image.
:::

#### Props

| Prop  | Type   | Required | Description                                                               |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src` | string | ✅ Yes   | Relative path to the image (from the `/RMC-Software-Documentation/` root) |

:::caution
This component does **not** support `alt` text. If accessibility is a requirement, use the `<img>` tag directly or extend this component.
:::

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import FigureInline from '@site/src/components/FigureInline';

Here is a comparison chart <FigureInline src="figures/chart-thumbnail.png" /> that shows the performance differences between models.

```

---

### FigureReference

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<FigureReference>` component is used to dynamically insert a numbered reference to a figure within a sentence or paragraph. It fetches
the correct figure number from the centralized `counters.json` file using the provided `figKey`, and renders text such as `Figure 5`.

**Functionality includes:**

- Retrieves the current `reportId` from context via `useReportId()`
- Loads the counters file from:
  - `/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/{reportId}.json`
- Locates the figure number using the provided `figKey`
- Renders a simple inline label like `Figure 2`

:::note
This component is useful for cross-referencing figures from elsewhere in the document. It does **not** render the image itself—only the figure
number.
:::

#### Props

| Prop     | Type   | Required | Description                                                       |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `figKey` | string | ✅ Yes   | Unique key for the figure, matching an entry in the counters file |

:::caution
If the `figKey` is not found or the counters file fails to load, the output will display `Loading...`. Console warnings will indicate the
missing reference.
:::

#### Example Usage

Use `<FigureReference />` inline to refer to a previously inserted `<Figure />`:

```jsx
import FigureReference from '@site/src/components/FigureReference';

As shown in <FigureReference figKey="fig_infiltration_diagram" />, infiltration occurs vertically through the embankment core...

```

---

### NavContainer

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<NavContainer>` component provides a consistent layout for displaying **navigation and version selection controls** at the top of a documentation page. It wraps two subcomponents:

- `<NavLink />`: A [navigational link](#navlink) back to a parent page or section.
- `<VersionSelector />`: A dropdown for selecting available document versions.

This layout ensures users always have quick access to both the document structure and alternate versions of the current content.

**Functionality includes:**

- Displays a styled navigation link using the provided `link` and `linkTitle`.
- Displays a version selector dropdown based on the `document` prop.
- Organizes both elements using a flexible container layout styled via `nav-container.css`.

:::note
This component is a layout utility and does not manage routing or version state itself. It delegates those tasks to `<NavLink />` and `<VersionSelector />`.
:::

#### Props

| Prop        | Type   | Required | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `link`      | string | ✅ Yes   | The relative path to the parent or target page for navigation                |
| `linkTitle` | string | ✅ Yes   | The text label for the navigation link (e.g., "Back to Overview")            |
| `document`  | string | ✅ Yes   | The identifier used by `<VersionSelector />` to determine available versions |

:::caution
All three props are required. Omitting any of them may result in broken layout or missing navigation elements.
:::

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import NavContainer from '@site/src/components/NavContainer';

<NavContainer
  link="/docs/project-x/overview"
  linkTitle="← Back to Project Overview"
  document="project-x"
/>

```

---

### NavLink

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<NavLink>` component renders a styled navigational link that points to a related page within your Docusaurus site. It is typically used to provide a “Back to…” or “Return to…” link at the top of a documentation page, and is often embedded inside `<NavContainer />`.

**Functionality includes:**

- Resolves the base URL dynamically using Docusaurus’ `useBaseUrl()` hook.
- Wraps the destination in a `<Link />` component for proper SPA navigation.
- Renders left-pointing arrow (`←`) followed by a custom label from `linkTitle`.
- Styled via the shared `nav-and-print.css` class set.

:::note
This component is purely presentational. It does not conditionally render or validate whether the target path exists.
:::

#### Props

| Prop        | Type   | Required | Description                                                               |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `link`      | string | ✅ Yes   | The relative path to the destination page (e.g., `/docs/project-x/intro`) |
| `linkTitle` | string | ✅ Yes   | The text displayed next to the arrow (e.g., `Back to Overview`)           |

:::caution
Make sure `link` is a valid internal route in your Docusaurus project. External URLs will not work properly here.
:::

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import NavLink from '@site/src/components/NavLink';

<NavLink
  link="/docs/project-x/overview"
  linkTitle="Back to Project Overview"
/>

```

---

### TableAcronyms

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<TableAcronyms>` component was created specifically to display acronyms and their long-form definitions in a static, two-column vertical
table. This component is to be used in the Acronym appendix of documents.

**Functionality includes:**

- Accepts a list of column headers and column data arrays as props.
- Dynamically computes the number of rows based on the length of the first column.
- Renders a simple HTML `<table>` with:
  - One `<thead>` row for column labels
  - Multiple `<tbody>` rows built from corresponding items in each column

:::note
This component renders a **fixed-layout** table. It does not support dynamic sorting, filtering, or merging of cells.
:::

#### Props

| Prop      | Type     | Required | Description                                                                |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `headers` | string[] | ✅ Yes   | An array of column labels (typically `["Acronym", "Definition"]`)          |
| `columns` | array[]  | ✅ Yes   | An array of arrays, where each inner array represents one column of values |

:::caution
All columns must have the same number of rows. Empty cells will be padded automatically, but uneven arrays may produce unexpected results.
:::

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import TableAcronyms from '@site/src/components/TableAcronyms';

<TableAcronyms
  headers={["Acronym", "Definition"]}

### TableHorizontal

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<TableHorizontal>` component displays a horizontal table where **headers are listed vertically in the first column**, and corresponding row
data is arranged to the right. This format is useful for comparing attribute values side-by-side across multiple items.

It also supports automatic **table numbering** via a central `counters.json` file, ensuring consistent references across documents.

**Functionality includes:**

- Loads the current `reportId` from context using `useReportId()`
- Retrieves the table number using `tableKey` from:
  - `/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/{reportId}.json`
- Displays:
  - A caption with the resolved table number
  - A horizontal layout where each row starts with a header and is followed by values
- Supports inline HTML formatting inside cells using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

:::note
This component is designed for **transposed tables**—use it when each row represents a field and each column represents a different scenario
or category.

This component handles table **numbering and display**. To insert an inline table reference (e.g., "see Table 3"), use the `<TableReference />`
component.

#### Props

| Prop       | Type     | Required | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tableKey` | string   | ✅ Yes   | Unique key used to match the table in the `counters.json` file           |
| `headers`  | string[] | ✅ Yes   | Array of header labels for each row (first column of the table)          |
| `rows`     | array[]  | ✅ Yes   | 2D array of cell values (one array per row, excluding the header column) |
| `alt`      | string   | ✅ Yes   | Alternative text for accessibility and screen readers                    |
| `caption`  | string   | ✅ Yes   | Descriptive text shown under the table number                            |

:::caution
Make sure the number of `headers` matches the number of `rows`. Mismatches will result in misaligned rows or rendering issues.

If tableKey is not found or the counters file cannot be loaded, the component will fallback to `Loading...`. Console warnings will be shown to
help with debugging.
:::

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import TableHorizontal from '@site/src/components/TableHorizontal';

<TableHorizontal
  tableKey="overtopping-depth-duration"
  headers={["Overtopping Depth (ft)", "Overtopping Duration (hrs)"]}
  rows={[
    ["0", "0.5", "1.0", "1.5", "2.0"],
    ["0", "2", "4", "8", "13", "20"]
  ]}
  alt="Overtopping depth and duration comparison"
  caption="Overtopping durations in hours for given peak overtopping depths in feet."
/>
```

### TableReference

#### Overview and Functionality

The `<TableReference>` component is used to insert dynamic references to tables elsewhere in the documentation. When given a `tableKey`,
it fetches the corresponding table number from the centralized `counters.json` file associated with the current `reportId` and displays it
inline as `Table 4`, for example.

This helps maintain consistent, automatically updated references across pages—even if table numbering changes during editing.

**Functionality includes:**

- Retrieves the active `reportId` from context via `useReportId()`
- Loads table metadata from:
  - `/RMC-Software-Documentation/counters/{reportId}.json`
- Locates and displays the table number that matches the given `tableKey`
- Renders a styled inline reference like `Table 5`

:::note
This component is used for **text references only**. It does not render the full table. To display an actual table, use a component
like `<TableHorizontal />` or `<TableVertical />`.

#### Props

| Prop       | Type   | Required | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tableKey` | string | ✅ Yes   | Unique key used to locate the table number in the `counters.json` file |

:::caution
If tableKey is not found or the counters file cannot be loaded, the component will fallback to `Loading...`. Console warnings will be shown to
help with debugging.
:::

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import TableReference from '@site/src/components/TableReference';

The material properties shown in <TableReference tableKey="table_material_properties" /> illustrate typical values for different
embankment zones.
```
