# Docx Converter

## Overview

The `docx_converter` Python script is designed to automate the conversion of Microsoft Word (`.docx`) documents using the standard RMC Word Document Template into modular
MDX files, suitable for use with Docusaurus or other React-based documentation systems. It extracts and processes figures, tables, equations, citations, and document
structure, outputting clean, component-rich MDX files and associated assets. This script allows for efficient conversion of existing Word documents into the RMC Software
Documentation site format.

:::warning

**This script will not work if the DOCX file does not follow the standard RMC Word Document Template.**  
Ensure your document is formatted correctly before running the script.

### File Structure

Below is a typical file structure for the `docx_to_mdx` script, with a brief description of each file’s purpose.

```
docx_to_mdx/
│
├── main.py                # Entry point; orchestrates the DOCX to MDX conversion process.
├── utils/                 # Folder housing all utility and helper files for main.py

### File Descriptions

- **main.py**  
  The main script to run. Handles user prompts, sets up input/output paths, and calls the appropriate modules to process the DOCX and generate MDX files and assets.

- **constants.py**  
  Stores style names, mappings, and other constants used to identify and process elements in the DOCX file (e.g., which styles correspond to headings, figures, tables, etc.).

- **helpers.py**  
  Provides utility functions for formatting text, handling JSX/MDX output, file and directory operations, user confirmations, and other shared logic.

- **figures.py**  
  Contains logic for detecting figures in the DOCX, extracting and saving figure images, parsing and cleaning captions, and generating MDX-compatible figure components and references.

- **tables.py**  
  Handles extraction of tables from the DOCX, formatting them as Markdown or MDX components, and managing table references.

- **citations.py**  
  Parses in-text citations and bibliography entries, formats them for MDX, and links them to the bibliography if provided.

- **equations.py**  
  Extracts equations and equation references from the DOCX, formats them for MDX, and generates appropriate components.

- **docx_processor.py**  
  The core parser that reads the DOCX file, identifies document structure (sections, headings, paragraphs), and coordinates the extraction of figures, tables, equations, and citations.

- **mdx_writer.py**  
  Responsible for writing the processed content to MDX files, organizing sections, and ensuring correct references and imports for assets.

- **README.md**  
  Provides an overview, usage instructions, requirements, and other documentation for users of the script.

## What It Does

1. **Configuration and Setup**

   - The user specifies input and output paths for the DOCX file, bibliography, figures directory, and MDX output directory in `main.py`.
   - The script checks for required dependencies and prompts the user to confirm whether the input variables are set correctly and whether figures should be regenerated within
     the figures folder of the Docusaurus project.

2. **DOCX Parsing**

   - The script loads the DOCX file using `python-docx` and parses the document structure, identifying sections, headings, paragraphs, figures, tables, equations, and citations
     based on style mappings defined in `constants.py`.

3. **Figure Extraction**

   - Figures are detected by their style (e.g., "RMC_Figure").
   - Each figure image is extracted and saved as a PNG file in the specified figures directory.
   - Figure captions are parsed, cleaned, and associated with the correct image.

4. **Table Extraction**

   - Tables are identified and converted into Markdown or MDX table components.
   - Table captions and references are handled and linked appropriately.

5. **Equation and Citation Handling**

   - Inline equations and references are detected and formatted for MDX.
   - Citations are parsed and linked to the provided bibliography file.

6. **Section and Navigation Structure**

   - The script builds a modular section structure, splitting the document into logical MDX files based on headings.
   - Navigation metadata can be generated for Docusaurus sidebars.

7. **MDX File Generation**

   - Each section, figure, table, and equation is written to an MDX file in the output directory.
   - MDX files include custom React components for figures, tables, and references, ready for use in Docusaurus.

8. **Asset Management**
   - All extracted images are saved to the figures directory.
   - Relative paths are set so MDX files can reference images correctly.

## Output

:::tip

The script generates the necessary MDX files and figures to allow the Docusaurus project to build the document. When successful, the document will be in draft form and
ready for review following minor edits.

:::

Outputs include:

- **MDX Files:**  
  Modular `.mdx` files for each section or chapter of the original DOCX, placed in your specified output directory (e.g., `docs/` or `docs/generated/`).
- **Figures:**  
  Extracted figure images as `.png` files, saved in the designated figures directory (e.g., `static/img/figures/`).

---

## Usage

1. **Install Python**

   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended) and Install Dependencies**

   - Create a virtual environment in the `docx_converter/` folder:

     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Set the **Environment** for the conversion

   - The script is set up to allow for **practice** conversions in a **development** environment to test the procedure and ensure that the script is acting as expected.
   - To set the environment, open `main.py` and set the `ENVIRONMENT` variable
     to either `development` or `production`.

   - `development` will allow you to test the script without affecting the main documentation.
   - `production` will run the script as intended for the final documentation.

   ```python
   ENVIRONMENT = "development"  # Change to "production" for final runs
   ```

4. Assign Input and Output Paths

   - Open `main.py` in the `docx_converter/` folder.
   - Set the following variables in `main.py`:

     - `FIGSRC`: File path of figures relative to the Docusaurus project root.Relative file path for the figure storage location (e.g., `static/img/figures/software/v1.0/figures`)

       - Used to inject the relative path for figures in the [Figure](/docs/documentation-guide/react-components#figure) component

     - `NAVLINK`, `NAVTITLE`, `NAVDOC`: Navigation settings for the [NavContainer](/docs/documentation-guide/react-components#navcontainer) component

     - `DOCX_PATH`: Path to your input `.docx` file
     - `BIB_PATH`: Path to your bibliography JSON file; used for the [Citation](/docs/documentation-guide/react-components#citation) component
     - `FIGURES_DIR`: Output directory for extracted figures (e.g., `../static/img/figures`)
     - `MDX_DIR`: Output directory for generated MDX files (e.g., `../docs/generated`)

5. **Run the Script**

   - Ensure your **virtual environment** is activated

     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - Open a new **terminal** using `` `Ctrl + Shift + ` `` or clicking "Terminal -> New Terminal"

   - Navigate to the docx_converter folder in the Terminal
     `cd docx_converter`

   - From the `docx_converter` folder, run one of the following commands (depending on how Python is configured on your system):

     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```

     ```sh
     python3 main.py
     ```

     ```sh
     py main.py
     ```

   - The script will prompt you to confirm the following:
     - Whether the input and output variables are set correctly (Y or N). If you choose N, the script will exit.
     - Whether to regenerate figures in the Docusaurus project directory (Y or N). If all figures from the DOCX are already present in the figures directory,
       you can choose not to regenerate them (N). If you choose to regenerate figures (Y), the script will overwrite existing images in the figures directory.

6. **Check Outputs**

   - Find your generated `.mdx` files in the output directory you specified (e.g., `docs/generated/`).
   - Find extracted figure images in the figures directory (e.g., `static/img/figures/`).

7. **Integrate with Docusaurus**

   - The generated MDX files and images are now ready for use in the Docusaurus site.

:::info

This Python script is a preprocessing tool. It is not run by Docusaurus at runtime, but before you build or serve your site.
For troubleshooting, check the console output and review the generated files for formatting or extraction issues.
