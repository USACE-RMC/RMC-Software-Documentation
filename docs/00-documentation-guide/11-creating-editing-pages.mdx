# Creating and Editing Pages

The documents in this website are authored using MDX. `.mdx` (Markdown + JSX) allows you to write Markdown content and use React components side-by-side.

To create a new document in Visual Studio Code, right-click on the folder where the file will be located and click "New File". If the required folder does
not exist for your hub/sub-hub/document, create it first, following the naming and numbering convention outlined in the [`docs/`](./05-docs-folder.mdx) section.
Name the file with your desired name and add `.mdx` for the document type.

:::warning

**If you are unsure where to place your document or how to format the folder structure, please contact a site administrator.**

## Python Document Conversion Script

A Python script has been developed to convert Word documents following the standard RMC Word template into `.mdx` format. The script extracts figures, tables,
equations, citations, and section structure, and outputs clean, component-rich MDX files. For additional details, see
the [DOCX to MDX Converter](./06-scripts.mdx) section.

---

## MDX Basics

- **File extension:** `.mdx`
- **Location:** Inside the `docs` folder
- **Behavior:** Treated as pages in Docusaurus when placed in the `docs` folder and linked in the sidebar

---

## Front Matter

`.mdx` files can begin with YAML front matter, wrapped in triple dashes.  
In this project, front matter is used to define the title of each `.mdx` page, which is displayed in the browser tab heading.

```mdx
---
title: Schmertmann
---

---

## title: Appendix A - Acronyms
```

Expanded front matter is used in `00-document-info.mdx` pages and is passed as a prop to the `<DocumentMetadata>` React component:

reportTitle: RMC Backward Erosion Piping (Progression) Toolbox
reportSubTitle: RMC Internal Erosion Suite
reportAuthors: ["Tim O'Leary, Risk Management Center"]
reportAbstract: The spreadsheet tools contained in this toolbox deterministically and probabilistically assess the likelihood of backward erosion piping progression (hydraulic condition) using the adjusted Schmertmann (2000) method and the adjusted calculation rule of Sellmeijer et al. (2011) in addition to creep ratio methods of Bligh (1910) and Lane (1935).

## Markdown Content

`.mdx` supports standard Markdown syntax out of the box.

### Headings

Use `#` to `######` to create headings from level 1 to 6:

```md
# H1

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6
```

### Text Formatting

You can use both Markdown and HTML tags to format text:

```html
<b>Bold text</b>
<strong>Bold text</strong>
**Bold text**
<i>Italic text</i>
<em>Italic text</em>
_Italic text_
<b><i>Bold and italic text</i></b>
<u>Underline text</u>
<sub>Subscript text</sub>
<sup>Superscript text</sup>
```

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks

- Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
- To force a line break, end the line with two spaces.
- Line breaks can also be inserted by using `<br />`.

### Lists

- Bullet list:

```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 2.1
  - Sub-item 2.2
```

- Numbered list:

```md
1. Step one
2. Step two
   1. Sub-step
```

### Code Blocks

**Inline code:** Use backticks for inline code: `` `Inline code block` ``

**Fenced code block (with syntax highlighting):**

```js title="example.js"
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

**Live code block (primarily supports JSX):**

```jsx live
function Hello({ name = "Name" }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## JSX and Components

React components can be inserted anywhere in `.mdx` files.  
Components must be imported from the `src` folder into the `.mdx` file before they can be used.

```jsx
import { MyComponent } from "@site/src/components/MyComponent";

<MyComponent someProp="value" />;
```

React components available within the RMC Software Documentation project are outlined in the [React Components](./12-react-components.mdx) section.

---

## Best Practices

- Use clear, consistent naming for all `.mdx` files.
- Always start each document with `00-document-info.mdx` and `00-version-history.mdx`.
- Use numeric prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) for main chapters and appendices to ensure correct ordering in the sidebar.
- Place all images, figures, and supporting files in the appropriate subfolders under `static/`.
- Use front matter to set the page title and metadata.
- Import and use React components as needed for advanced formatting and dynamic content.
