# Other Files

This section describes additional important files in the RMC Software Documentation project that are not covered elsewhere.

---

## docusaurus.config.js

This is the main configuration file for the Docusaurus site.  
It defines site metadata, theme options, plugins, navigation, and other global settings.

---

## tailwind.config.js

This file defines our Tailwind CSS setup for the documentation site. It extends the default Tailwind theme with project-specific
design tokens and responsive behaviors that align with USACE branding and Groundwork standards.

### Features

#### Dark Mode

This project uses "class" mode with `[data-theme="dark"]` as the selector. This allows dark mode to toggle via Docusaurus' built-in
theme system.

```js
darkMode: ["class", '[data-theme="dark"]'];
```

#### Content Scanning

Tailwind scans `src`, `docs`, `blog`, and `index.html` for class names. This ensures unused styles are purged correctly and all
Markdown/MDX content is covered.

```js
content: [
  "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./docs/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,md,mdx}",
  "./blog/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,md,mdx}",
  "./index.html",
];
```

#### Theme Extensions

Key design tokens are defined under `theme.extend`:

    - **Font Sizes**: The project uses clamp(...) for fluid, responsive typography. Headings (h1–h6), body text (normal), and other sizes like
    caption, large, and navbar are all defined for consistency across breakpoints.
    - **Font Family**: All documentation text uses the `usace` font stack: `Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`.
    - **Custom Colors**:
        - Static USACE brand colors (e.g., `usace-box-red`, `gov-banner-gray`)
        - Navigation and footer-specific colors
        - CSS variable bindings (e.g., `--font-color`, `--ifm-link-color`) for theme responsiveness
    - **Grid Utilities**: Adds a custom `1fr-auto` row template for layouts that need a fixed footer

#### Screens (Breakpoints)

The project defines `sm`, `md`, and `lg` explicitly:

    - `sm`: 0px - mobile-first baseline
    - `md`: 900px - triggers multi-column layouts
    - `lg`: 1760px - used to cap content width or enable wide layouts

### Tips for developers

- Use the named `fontSize` keys (e.g., `text-normal`, `text-caption`) instead of raw Tailwind sizes for consistency across the site
- Use CSS variables (e.g., `text-font-color`, `ifm-primary`) to support dark/light theming automatically

## Project Dependencies

- **`package.json`**  
  Lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata.  
  Defines the required versions of packages needed to run or build the documentation site, and includes custom scripts like `counters`,
  `versions`, `run`, `start`, `build`, and `deploy` for Docusaurus.

- **`package-lock.json`**  
  Locks the exact versions of every package (and sub-package) installed at the time of `npm install`.  
  Ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same dependency versions, which improves consistency across environments.

---

## .gitignore and .gitattributes

- **`.gitignore`**  
  Specifies files and folders that should be excluded from version control (e.g., `node_modules/`, build artifacts, local environment files).

- **`.gitattributes`**  
  Used to define attributes per path, such as end-of-line normalization and diff settings.

---

## .nojekyll

This file tells GitHub Pages to bypass Jekyll processing, allowing files and folders that start with an underscore (`_`) to be served.

---

## README.md

Provides an overview of the website and a link to this Documentation Guide from the GitHub repository.
