# DOCX to MDX Converter

## Overview

The DOCX Converter is a Python script that automatically converts Microsoft Word documents (using the standard RMC Word Document Template) into MDX format ready for the RMC Software Documentation site. This tool saves significant time when you have existing documentation in Word format that needs to be added to the website.

:::tip When to Use This Tool

Use the DOCX converter when:

- You have an existing RMC document in Word format
- The document follows the standard RMC Word Document Template
- You want to quickly create MDX files without manual conversion

:::

:::warning Important Requirement

**This script only works with documents that follow the standard RMC Word Document Template.**

If your Word document doesn't use the RMC template, the converter won't work correctly. The script relies on specific styles and formatting conventions from the template to identify figures, tables, equations, and document structure.

:::

---

## What the Converter Does

The DOCX Converter automatically handles:

✅ **Document Structure**

- Extracts headings and creates separate MDX files for each chapter
- Maintains proper heading hierarchy
- Preserves formatting (bold, italic, lists)

✅ **Figures**

- Extracts all images from the Word document
- Saves them as PNG files in the correct folder
- Converts figure captions to MDX format
- Creates `<Figure>` components with automatic numbering

✅ **Tables**

- Extracts all tables
- Converts to `<TableVertical>` or `<TableHorizontal>` components
- Preserves table formatting and structure
- Maintains table captions

:::danger Tables with Merged Cells

If a table contains merged cells, the conversion may not be seamless. The script adds a danger admonition to alert contributors that they should manually verify the proper table structure and make corrections as needed.

:::

⚠️ **Equations**

- Detects mathematical equations in the Word document
- **Cannot automatically convert equations to LaTeX format**
- Inserts admonitions where equations are detected:
  - For standalone equations: admonition placed at the equation's location
  - For inline equations: admonition placed above the paragraph containing them
- Contributors must manually add equations using the `<Equation>` component

⚠️ **Citations**

- Identifies in-text citations
- Creates `<Citation>` components
- Links to bibliography file

:::warning Citation Text May Be Removed

The script sometimes removes author names and years that directly precede citations. For example:

- Source text: "Foster and Fell (2024)"
- May convert to: `<Citation citationKey="FosterFell2024" />`
- Should be: `Foster and Fell (2024) <Citation citationKey="FosterFell2024" />`

Contributors should verify that citation text is properly preserved during conversion.

:::

✅ **Document Metadata**

- Extracts title, authors, date, abstract
- Creates front matter for MDX files

**Result:** The converter significantly reduces conversion time by automatically handling document structure, figures, tables, and basic formatting. While the output requires review and some manual refinement, it saves hours of work compared to manual conversion.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using the DOCX converter, ensure you have:

### 1. Python Installation

**Version Required:** Python 3.8 or higher

**Check if you have Python:**

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

**If you don't have Python:**

- Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

### 2. Word Document Using RMC Template

Your Word document must:

- Follow the modern RMC Word Document Template (e.g., Blue, Red, Green, or Yellow themes)
- Use correct style names (RMC_Figure, RMC_Table, etc.)
- Have properly formatted citations and references

### 3. Bibliography File Created

Before running the converter:

- Create a `bib.json` file with all document references
- Place it in the appropriate location in `static/bibliographies/`
- Format according to [Project Structure](./03-project-structure.mdx#staticbibliographies---citation-files)

**Why this is required:**
The converter needs the bibliography file to properly link in-text citations. If citations exist in the Word document but not in `bib.json`, the conversion will have errors.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Converter Folder

Open Terminal in VS Code (`` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``) and navigate to the converter:

```bash
cd docx_converter
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment keeps the converter's Python packages separate from your system Python.

:::tip Why Use a Virtual Environment?

Virtual environments prevent conflicts between different Python projects. The converter requires specific package versions that might differ from other Python tools you use.

**Important:** Create the virtual environment ONLY in the `docx_converter/` folder, NOT in the root of the project.

:::

**Create the virtual environment:**

Use one of the following commands to create the virtual environment (which one depends on your Python installation):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

or

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

or

```bash
py -m venv venv
```

**Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

**When activated successfully:**
You'll see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt:

```bash
(venv) C:\GitHub\RMC-Software-Documentation\docx_converter>
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:

- `python-docx` - For reading Word documents
- Other dependencies needed for conversion

**Installation time:** ~30 seconds to 1 minute

## Conversion Workflow

### Overview of the Process

```
1. Prepare Word Document & Bibliography
    ↓
2. Configure Converter Settings (main.py)
    ↓
3. Run in Development Mode (test)
    ↓
4. Review Generated Files
    ↓
5. Assess Output & Note Issues
    ↓
6. Run in Production Mode (final)
    ↓
7. Make Manual Refinements
    ↓
8. Test and Commit
```

---

## Detailed Conversion Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

#### A. Place Word Document

Place your `.docx` file in the `static/source-documents/` folder following the same folder structure used for docs, figures, and bibliographies.

**Example structure:**

```
static/source-documents/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0/your-document.docx
```

This organizational structure keeps all related files (source documents, MDX files, figures, and bibliographies) aligned across the project.

#### B. Create Bibliography File

Before conversion, create `bib.json` with all references:

**Location example:**

```
static/bibliographies/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0/bib.json
```

See [Project Structure](./03-project-structure.mdx#staticbibliographies---citation-files) for bibliography format and examples.

---

### Step 2: Configure the Converter

Open `docx_converter/main.py` in VS Code and configure these settings:

#### A. Set Environment Mode

```python
# Line ~20
ENVIRONMENT = "development"  # Start with development to test
```

**Environment modes:**

- **`development`** - Test mode
  - Safe to experiment
  - Outputs to temporary location
  - Won't overwrite existing docs
  - **Always start here!**

- **`production`** - Final mode
  - Outputs directly to docs folder
  - Will overwrite existing files
  - **Only use after testing in development**

#### B. Configure Paths

Find and set these variables in `main.py`:

**Figure Path (FIGSRC):**

```python
# Path used in <Figure> component src attributes
# Figure filenames will be appended (e.g., "figure-1.png")
FIGSRC = "figures/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"
```

This path appears in the generated MDX files and must match where figures are stored in `static/`. Always use forward slashes `/`.

**Navigation Component Settings:**

```python
# NAVLINK: URL destination for the back arrow navigation
NAVLINK = "/desktop-applications/your-software"

# NAVTITLE: Display text shown in the navigation link
NAVTITLE = "User's Guide"

# NAVDOC: Document identifier for version selector
# Must match the key in versionList.json
NAVDOC = "desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide"
```

These configure the `NavContainer` component at the top of each page, providing navigation back to parent pages and version selection.

**Development Environment Paths:**

```python
# DOCX_PATH: Location of source Word document
DOCX_PATH = r"C:\path\to\your-document.docx"

# BIB_PATH: Location of bibliography file
BIB_PATH = r"C:\GitHub\RMC-Software-Documentation\static\bibliographies\desktop-applications\your-software\users-guide\v1.0\bib.json"

# FIGURES_DIR: Temporary output directory for extracted figures (testing)
FIGURES_DIR = r"C:\temp\conversion-test\figures"

# MDX_DIR: Temporary output directory for generated MDX files (testing)
MDX_DIR = r"C:\temp\conversion-test\mdx"
```

**Production Environment Paths:**

```python
# DOCX_PATH: Location of source Word document (typically same as development)
DOCX_PATH = r"C:\path\to\your-document.docx"

# BIB_PATH: Location of bibliography file (typically same as development)
BIB_PATH = r"C:\GitHub\RMC-Software-Documentation\static\bibliographies\desktop-applications\your-software\users-guide\v1.0\bib.json"

# FIGURES_DIR: Final output directory for figures
FIGURES_DIR = r"C:\GitHub\RMC-Software-Documentation\static\figures\desktop-applications\your-software\users-guide\v1.0"

# MDX_DIR: Final output directory for MDX files
MDX_DIR = r"C:\GitHub\RMC-Software-Documentation\docs\desktop-applications\your-software\users-guide\v1.0"
```

**Path Configuration Tips:**

- **DOCX_PATH** and **BIB_PATH** are typically the same for both environments
- **FIGURES_DIR** and **MDX_DIR** differ: development uses temporary locations, production uses final project locations
- Use absolute paths (full paths starting from drive letter on Windows)
- Forward slashes `/` work on all platforms and are recommended
- Backslashes `\` work on Windows but should be in raw strings (prefix with `r`)

:::warning Critical: Verify Your Paths

**Incorrect paths in production mode can overwrite existing documentation!**

Always:

1. Start with `ENVIRONMENT = "development"`
2. Test thoroughly
3. Then switch to `ENVIRONMENT = "production"`
4. Double-check production paths before running

:::

---

### Step 3: Run Development Mode (Test)

#### A. Ensure Settings Are Correct

✓ `ENVIRONMENT = "development"`  
✓ All paths point to correct locations  
✓ Bibliography file exists and is complete  
✓ Virtual environment is activated (you see `(venv)` in terminal)

#### B. Run the Converter

From the `docx_converter/` folder:

```bash
python main.py
```

or

```bash
python3 main.py
```

or

```bash
py main.py
```

#### C. Respond to Prompts

The script will ask:

**Prompt 1:**

```
Are the input and output variables set correctly? (Y/N):
```

- Type `Y` if paths are correct
- Type `N` to exit and fix paths

**Prompt 2:**

```
Regenerate figures in the Docusaurus project directory? (Y/N):
```

- Type `Y` to extract all images from Word (first run)
- Type `N` if images already exist and you don't want to overwrite

#### D. Monitor Progress

You'll see output like:

```
Processing DOCX file...
Extracting figures... (15 found)
Extracting tables... (8 found)
Processing equations... (12 found)
Parsing citations... (23 found)
Writing MDX files...
  - 00-document-info.mdx
  - 00-version-history.mdx
  - 01-preface.mdx
  - 02-introduction.mdx
  ...
Conversion complete!
```

**Conversion time:** 10 seconds to 2 minutes depending on document size

---

### Step 4: Review Generated Files

#### A. Check MDX Files

Navigate to your output directory (specified in `MDX_DIR`).

**Review each file for:**

**Basic Structure:**

✓ Headings are correct  
✓ Text formatting preserved (bold, italic, lists)  
✓ Figure components look right

**Tables (pay special attention):**

✓ Table components render properly  
✓ **Check for danger admonitions** marking tables with merged cells  
✓ Verify table structure is correct, especially for complex tables

**Equations (require manual work):**

✓ **Look for equation admonitions** placed by the converter

- Standalone equations: admonition at equation location
- Inline equations: admonition above paragraph

✓ Plan to manually add LaTeX equations using `<Equation>` component  
✓ Note which sections have equations needing conversion

**Citations (verify carefully):**

✓ Citation components are present  
✓ **Author names and years are preserved** (not removed)

- Should be: "Foster and Fell (2024) `<Citation citationKey="FosterFell2024" />`"
- Not: "`<Citation citationKey="FosterFell2024" />`" (missing text)

✓ Citation keys match entries in bib.json  
✓ Citations link correctly to bibliography

#### B. Check Extracted Images

Navigate to your figures directory (specified in `FIGURES_DIR`).

**Verify:**

✓ All images extracted  
✓ Images are clear (not blurry or pixelated)  
✓ Filenames are reasonable  
✓ File sizes are appropriate (< 500KB each ideally)

#### C. Test Locally

With the dev server running (`npm start` from project root):

1. Navigate to your converted document in the browser
2. Check all pages render correctly
3. Verify figure numbering works
4. Test cross-references
5. Check citations link to bibliography

**Common issues to look for:**

- Missing images (check image paths)
- Broken references (check unique keys)
- Formatting problems (may need manual fixes)
- **Tables with merged cells flagged by danger admonitions**
- **Equation admonitions requiring manual LaTeX conversion**
- **Missing citation text** (author names/years removed by converter)

---

### Step 5: Assess Development Output

After reviewing the development output, assess whether the conversion worked well enough to proceed to production.

#### Determine If You're Ready for Production

**The conversion is ready for production mode if:**

✓ Document structure is generally correct (headings, paragraphs)  
✓ Figures extracted successfully  
✓ Tables converted (even if flagged with admonitions)  
✓ Citations are present (even if missing some text)  
✓ No critical errors or missing content

**You may need to adjust the Word document and re-run development mode if:**

✗ Major structural problems (chapters missing, wrong order)  
✗ Most figures didn't extract  
✗ Converter crashed or produced errors  
✗ Bibliography file missing or incorrect

#### Note What Needs Manual Fixing Later

**Don't make manual edits to the development output files!** Instead, make a note of issues to fix after the production run:

**Equations (will always need work):**

- Count how many equation admonitions were created
- Note which sections have the most equations
- Plan time for LaTeX conversion after production run

**Tables with merged cells:**

- Identify which tables have danger admonitions
- Reference page numbers in original Word document
- Plan to fix these tables after production run

**Citations:**

- Scan a few citations to see if author names/years are missing
- If it's a pattern, expect to fix all citations after production run
- Verify bib.json has all needed entries

**Other issues:**

- Note any major formatting problems
- Identify any missing or incorrect content
- Document any unexpected converter behavior

:::tip Purpose of Development Mode

Development mode is for **testing and assessment only**. Once you confirm the conversion generally works, proceed to production mode. All manual refinements happen after the production run, not during development testing.

:::

---

### Step 6: Run Production Mode (Final)

Once you're satisfied with the development output:

#### A. Update Settings

In `main.py`:

```python
# Change from development to production
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
```

#### B. Verify Production Paths

**Critical: Double-check these paths!**

```python
# Ensure these point to final locations
FIGURES_DIR = "../static/figures/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"
MDX_DIR = "../docs/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"
```

**Verify the folders exist:**

- Create `docs/` folder structure if needed
- Create `static/figures/` folder structure if needed

#### C. Backup Existing Files (If Applicable)

If converting a new version and old files exist:

```bash
# Create backup of existing documentation
cp -r docs/path/to/old-version docs/path/to/old-version-backup
```

#### D. Run Production Conversion

```bash
python main.py
```

Respond to prompts:

- Confirm variables are correct: `Y`
- Regenerate figures: `Y` (for final run)

#### E. Final Review

After production conversion:

1. **Verify files are in correct location**
   - Check `docs/` folder
   - Check `static/figures/` folder

2. **Test with dev server**

   ```bash
   # From project root
   npm start
   ```

3. **Check all functionality**
   - Navigation works
   - All pages load
   - Images display
   - Cross-references work
   - Citations link correctly

---

### Step 7: Make Manual Refinements

Now that production files are in place, make the manual adjustments you identified in Step 5.

#### Required Manual Fixes

**Equations (always required):**

✓ **Locate all equation admonitions** placed by the converter  
✓ Open original Word document for equation reference  
✓ Convert Word equations to LaTeX format  
✓ Replace admonitions with `<Equation>` components  
✓ Test equation rendering in browser  
✓ See [React Components](./07-react-components.mdx) for equation examples

**Tables with merged cells:**

✓ **Find danger admonitions** marking problematic tables  
✓ Open original Word document for table reference  
✓ Manually verify and fix table structure in MDX  
✓ Adjust `<TableVertical>` or `<TableHorizontal>` components  
✓ Remove danger admonitions after fixing  
✓ Test table rendering in browser

**Citations (verify all):**

✓ **Check every citation** for missing author names/years  
✓ Add back any text removed by converter  
✓ Format should be: "Author (Year) `<Citation citationKey="..." />`"  
✓ Verify citation keys match bib.json entries  
✓ Test that citations link correctly to bibliography

#### Optional Refinements

**Formatting adjustments:**

✓ Adjust line breaks and spacing  
✓ Add missing bold/italic formatting  
✓ Fine-tune list formatting

**Component refinements:**

✓ Set figure widths appropriately  
✓ Adjust table column widths  
✓ Fine-tune caption text  
✓ Update component props as needed

**Content corrections:**

✓ Correct special characters  
✓ Adjust formatting for code blocks  
✓ Update outdated information

---

### Step 8: Test and Commit

#### A. Test with Development Server

After completing all manual refinements, test your converted documentation thoroughly:

```bash
npm start
```

This starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Verify:

✓ All pages load correctly  
✓ Navigation works properly  
✓ Images display correctly  
✓ Equations render properly  
✓ Tables are formatted correctly  
✓ Citations link to bibliography  
✓ Cross-references work  
✓ No console errors appear

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the development server when testing is complete.

:::info Production Build Not Required

**Contributors do NOT need to run `npm run build`** before committing. The development server (`npm start`) is sufficient for testing. Site administrators will handle building and deploying the site to production.

If you encounter any issues while testing locally, contact the repository administrator rather than attempting to troubleshoot build processes.

:::

#### B. Commit and Push Changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Python not recognized"

**Problem:** Terminal doesn't recognize `python` command.

**Solutions:**

- Try `python3` or `py` instead of `python`
- Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
- Restart terminal after Python installation

---

#### Issue: "No module named 'docx'"

**Problem:** Dependencies not installed.

**Solutions:**

- Ensure virtual environment is activated (see `(venv)` in terminal)
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try `pip3` instead of `pip`

---

#### Issue: "File not found" error

**Problem:** Incorrect file paths in `main.py`.

**Solutions:**

- Check paths are relative to `docx_converter/` folder
- Use forward slashes `/` not backslashes `\`
- Verify files actually exist at specified locations
- Use `../` to go up to project root

---

#### Issue: Figures not extracting

**Problem:** Images missing from converted output.

**Solutions:**

- Verify Word document has embedded images (not linked)
- Ensure images are in correct format (PNG, JPG)
- Check figure style is `RMC_Figure` in Word
- Answer `Y` to "Regenerate figures?" prompt

---

#### Issue: Tables look wrong

**Problem:** Complex tables don't convert correctly.

**Solutions:**

- Simple tables convert automatically
- Complex tables with merged cells may need manual adjustment
- Edit generated `<TableVertical>` components manually
- See [React Components](./07-react-components.mdx) for table examples

---

#### Issue: Equations display as text

**Problem:** Equations not converted to LaTeX.

**Solutions:**

- Check equations use proper Word equation editor (not plain text)
- Manually convert to LaTeX syntax if needed
- Use `<Equation>` component format from [React Components](./07-react-components.mdx)

---

#### Issue: Citations broken

**Problem:** Citations don't link to bibliography.

**Solutions:**

- Verify `bib.json` exists and is complete
- Check citation keys in Word match keys in `bib.json`
- Ensure `BIB_PATH` in `main.py` is correct
- Bibliography must be created **before** conversion

---

#### Issue: Conversion produces errors

**Problem:** Script crashes or reports errors.

**Solutions:**

- Check Word document follows RMC template
- Verify all required styles are present
- Look at error message for specific line number
- Try simpler document first to test setup

---

## Best Practices

### Before Conversion

**What you need to modify:**

- `main.py` - Configuration variables only

**What you don't need to touch:**

- Everything in `utils/` - Core converter logic
- `requirements.txt` - Dependency list
- `README.md` - Technical documentation

## Limitations

The converter has some limitations to be aware of:

### What Converts Well

✅ Standard paragraphs and headings  
✅ Simple to moderate tables  
✅ Embedded images  
✅ Standard equations  
✅ In-text citations  
✅ Lists (bulleted and numbered)  
✅ Basic formatting (bold, italic)

### What May Need Manual Work

⚠️ Very complex tables with multiple merged cells  
⚠️ Custom Word styles not in RMC template  
⚠️ Special characters or symbols  
⚠️ Advanced equation formatting  
⚠️ Footnotes (may need conversion to endnotes)  
⚠️ Text boxes and floating objects  
⚠️ Embedded objects (Excel charts, etc.)

### What Doesn't Convert

❌ Comments and tracked changes  
❌ Word forms and fields  
❌ Macros and VBA code  
❌ Custom fonts (uses site default)  
❌ Exact page layout (web is responsive)  
❌ Headers and footers  
❌ Page numbers and section breaks

## Tips for Success

### For First-Time Users

1. **Start small:** Try converting a single chapter first
2. **Use development mode:** Never skip testing
3. **Read error messages:** They usually tell you what's wrong
4. **Ask for help:** Contact site administrators if stuck
5. **Document your process:** Note what works and what doesn't

### For Repeat Users

1. **Create conversion checklist:** Document your specific workflow
2. **Save configurations:** Keep tested path settings
3. **Automate cleanup:** Develop scripts for common manual fixes
4. **Share learnings:** Help other contributors avoid issues

## Summary

### Conversion Workflow Recap

```
1. ✅ Install Python and dependencies
2. ✅ Prepare Word document and bibliography
3. ✅ Configure main.py (development mode)
4. ✅ Run development conversion
5. ✅ Review and assess output
6. ✅ Note issues for manual fixing
7. ✅ Switch to production mode
8. ✅ Run production conversion
9. ✅ Make manual refinements
10. ✅ Test and commit
```

### Key Takeaways

- The converter saves hours of manual conversion work
- Always test in development mode first
- Some manual refinement is usually needed
- Bibliography file must exist before conversion
- Word document must follow RMC template

### When to Use vs. Manual Creation

**Use the converter when:**

- You have a complete Word document
- Document follows RMC template or would not require substantial effort to convert to RMC template
- You want to save time on initial conversion

**Create MDX manually when:**

- Starting a new document from scratch
- Word document doesn't follow template and would require substantial effort to convert to RMC template
- Document is very short (< 10 pages)
- You need complete control over formatting

## Next Steps

After converting your document:

1. **Refine the output:** [Creating and Editing Pages](./06-creating-editing-pages.mdx)
2. **Use components:** [React Components](./07-react-components.mdx)
3. **Understand structure:** [Project Structure](./03-project-structure.mdx)
4. **Get help:** [Troubleshooting & FAQ](./09-troubleshooting-faq.mdx)

**Happy converting!** The DOCX converter is a powerful tool that can significantly speed up your documentation workflow.
