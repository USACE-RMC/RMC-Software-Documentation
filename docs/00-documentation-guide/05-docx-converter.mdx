# DOCX to MDX Converter

## Overview

The DOCX Converter is a Python script that automatically converts Microsoft Word documents (using the standard RMC Word Document Template) into MDX format ready for the RMC Software Documentation site. This tool saves significant time when you have existing documentation in Word format that needs to be added to the website.

:::tip When to Use This Tool

Use the DOCX converter when:

- You have an existing RMC document in Word format
- The document follows the standard RMC Word Document Template
- You want to quickly create MDX files without manual conversion

:::

:::warning Important Requirement

**This script only works with documents that follow the standard RMC Word Document Template.**

If your Word document doesn't use the RMC template, the converter won't work correctly. The script relies on specific styles and formatting conventions from the template to identify figures, tables, equations, and document structure.

:::

---

## What the Converter Does

The DOCX Converter automatically handles:

✅ **Document Structure**

- Extracts headings and creates separate MDX files for each chapter
- Maintains proper heading hierarchy
- Preserves formatting (bold, italic, lists)

✅ **Figures**

- Extracts all images from the Word document
- Saves them as PNG files in the correct folder
- Converts figure captions to MDX format
- Creates `<Figure>` components with automatic numbering

✅ **Tables**

- Extracts all tables
- Converts to `<TableVertical>` or `<TableHorizontal>` components
- Preserves table formatting and structure
- Maintains table captions

✅ **Equations**

- Extracts mathematical equations
- Converts to LaTeX format
- Creates `<Equation>` components with automatic numbering

✅ **Citations**

- Identifies in-text citations
- Creates `<Citation>` components
- Links to bibliography file

✅ **Document Metadata**

- Extracts title, authors, date, abstract
- Creates front matter for MDX files

**Result:** The converter produces draft-quality MDX files and images ready for review and integration into the documentation site.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using the DOCX converter, ensure you have:

### 1. Python Installation

**Version Required:** Python 3.8 or higher

**Check if you have Python:**

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

**If you don't have Python:**

- Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

### 2. Word Document Using RMC Template

Your Word document must:

- Follow the standard RMC Word Document Template
- Use correct style names (RMC_Figure, RMC_Table, etc.)
- Have properly formatted citations and references

### 3. Bibliography File Created

Before running the converter:

- Create a `bib.json` file with all document references
- Place it in the appropriate location in `static/bibliographies/`
- Format according to [Project Structure](./03-project-structure.mdx#staticbibliographies---citation-files)

**Why this is required:**
The converter needs the bibliography file to properly link in-text citations. If citations exist in the Word document but not in `bib.json`, the conversion will have errors.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Converter Folder

Open Terminal in VS Code (`` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``) and navigate to the converter:

```bash
cd docx_converter
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment keeps the converter's Python packages separate from your system Python.

:::tip Why Use a Virtual Environment?

Virtual environments prevent conflicts between different Python projects. The converter requires specific package versions that might differ from other Python tools you use.

**Important:** Create the virtual environment ONLY in the `docx_converter/` folder, NOT in the root of the project.

:::

**Create the virtual environment:**

Try each command until one works (depends on your Python installation):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

or

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

or

```bash
py -m venv venv
```

**Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

**When activated successfully:**
You'll see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt:

```bash
(venv) C:\GitHub\RMC-Software-Documentation\docx_converter>
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:

- `python-docx` - For reading Word documents
- Other dependencies needed for conversion

**Installation time:** ~30 seconds to 1 minute

## Conversion Workflow

### Overview of the Process

```
1. Prepare Word Document & Bibliography
    ↓
2. Configure Converter Settings (main.py)
    ↓
3. Run in Development Mode (test)
    ↓
4. Review Generated Files
    ↓
5. Run in Production Mode (final)
    ↓
6. Integrate into Documentation Site
```

---

## Detailed Conversion Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files

#### A. Place Word Document

Put your `.docx` file in an accessible location:

**Recommended location:**

```
static/source-documents/your-document-name.docx
```

#### B. Create Bibliography File

Before conversion, create `bib.json` with all references:

**Location example:**

```
static/bibliographies/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0/bib.json
```

See [Project Structure](./03-project-structure.mdx#staticbibliographies---citation-files) for bibliography format and examples.

---

### Step 2: Configure the Converter

Open `docx_converter/main.py` in VS Code and configure these settings:

#### A. Set Environment Mode

```python
# Line ~20
ENVIRONMENT = "development"  # Start with development to test
```

**Environment modes:**

- **`development`** - Test mode
  - Safe to experiment
  - Outputs to temporary location
  - Won't overwrite existing docs
  - **Always start here!**

- **`production`** - Final mode
  - Outputs directly to docs folder
  - Will overwrite existing files
  - **Only use after testing in development**

#### B. Configure Paths

Find and set these variables (around line 30-50):

```python
# Figure output location (relative to project root)
FIGSRC = "figures/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"

# Navigation settings (for NavContainer component)
NAVLINK = "../"  # Link back to parent
NAVTITLE = "User's Guide"  # Document title
NAVDOC = "documentation-guide"  # Parent document

# Input file paths
DOCX_PATH = "../static/source-documents/your-document.docx"
BIB_PATH = "../static/bibliographies/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0/bib.json"

# Output paths for development mode
FIGURES_DIR = "../static/figures/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"
MDX_DIR = "../docs/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"
```

**Path tips:**

- Use `../` to go up one folder level from `docx_converter/`
- All paths are relative to the `docx_converter/` folder
- Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows

:::warning Critical: Verify Your Paths

**Incorrect paths in production mode can overwrite existing documentation!**

Always:

1. Start with `ENVIRONMENT = "development"`
2. Test thoroughly
3. Then switch to `ENVIRONMENT = "production"`
4. Double-check production paths before running

:::

---

### Step 3: Run Development Mode (Test)

#### A. Ensure Settings Are Correct

- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT = "development"`
- [ ] All paths point to correct locations
- [ ] Bibliography file exists and is complete
- [ ] Virtual environment is activated (you see `(venv)` in terminal)

#### B. Run the Converter

From the `docx_converter/` folder:

```bash
python main.py
```

or

```bash
python3 main.py
```

or

```bash
py main.py
```

#### C. Respond to Prompts

The script will ask:

**Prompt 1:**

```
Are the input and output variables set correctly? (Y/N):
```

- Type `Y` if paths are correct
- Type `N` to exit and fix paths

**Prompt 2:**

```
Regenerate figures in the Docusaurus project directory? (Y/N):
```

- Type `Y` to extract all images from Word (first run)
- Type `N` if images already exist and you don't want to overwrite

#### D. Monitor Progress

You'll see output like:

```
Processing DOCX file...
Extracting figures... (15 found)
Extracting tables... (8 found)
Processing equations... (12 found)
Parsing citations... (23 found)
Writing MDX files...
  - 00-document-info.mdx
  - 00-version-history.mdx
  - 01-preface.mdx
  - 02-introduction.mdx
  ...
Conversion complete!
```

**Conversion time:** 10 seconds to 2 minutes depending on document size

---

### Step 4: Review Generated Files

#### A. Check MDX Files

Navigate to your output directory (specified in `MDX_DIR`).

**Review each file for:**

- [ ] Headings are correct
- [ ] Text formatting preserved
- [ ] Figure components look right
- [ ] Table components render properly
- [ ] Equations are in LaTeX format
- [ ] Citations link correctly

#### B. Check Extracted Images

Navigate to your figures directory (specified in `FIGURES_DIR`).

**Verify:**

- [ ] All images extracted
- [ ] Images are clear (not blurry or pixelated)
- [ ] Filenames are reasonable
- [ ] File sizes are appropriate (< 500KB each ideally)

#### C. Test Locally

With the dev server running (`npm start` from project root):

1. Navigate to your converted document in the browser
2. Check all pages render correctly
3. Verify figure numbering works
4. Test cross-references
5. Check citations link to bibliography

**Common issues to look for:**

- Missing images (check image paths)
- Broken references (check unique keys)
- Formatting problems (may need manual fixes)
- Incomplete tables (complex tables may need adjustment)

---

### Step 5: Make Manual Adjustments (If Needed)

The converter produces **draft-quality** output. You may need to:

#### Common Manual Fixes

**Formatting refinements:**

- Adjust line breaks and spacing
- Fix complex table layouts
- Refine equation formatting
- Add missing bold/italic formatting

**Component adjustments:**

- Add or update component props
- Set figure widths appropriately
- Adjust table column widths
- Fine-tune caption text

**Content corrections:**

- Fix OCR errors in equations
- Correct special characters
- Adjust formatting for code blocks
- Update outdated information

:::tip Save Time

Don't aim for perfection in development mode. Make sure the conversion is mostly correct, then make detailed refinements after the production run.

:::

---

### Step 6: Run Production Mode (Final)

Once you're satisfied with the development output:

#### A. Update Settings

In `main.py`:

```python
# Change from development to production
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
```

#### B. Verify Production Paths

**Critical: Double-check these paths!**

```python
# Ensure these point to final locations
FIGURES_DIR = "../static/figures/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"
MDX_DIR = "../docs/desktop-applications/your-software/users-guide/v1.0"
```

**Verify the folders exist:**

- Create `docs/` folder structure if needed
- Create `static/figures/` folder structure if needed

#### C. Backup Existing Files (If Applicable)

If converting a new version and old files exist:

```bash
# Create backup of existing documentation
cp -r docs/path/to/old-version docs/path/to/old-version-backup
```

#### D. Run Production Conversion

```bash
python main.py
```

Respond to prompts:

- Confirm variables are correct: `Y`
- Regenerate figures: `Y` (for final run)

#### E. Final Review

After production conversion:

1. **Verify files are in correct location**
   - Check `docs/` folder
   - Check `static/figures/` folder

2. **Test with dev server**

   ```bash
   # From project root
   npm start
   ```

3. **Check all functionality**
   - Navigation works
   - All pages load
   - Images display
   - Cross-references work
   - Citations link correctly

---

### Step 7: Integrate and Commit

#### A. Test Full Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure no errors during build process.

#### B. Commit Changes

Using GitHub Desktop or command line:

```bash
git add docs/your-new-files/
git add static/figures/your-new-images/
git commit -m "Add converted documentation for [Software Name] v1.0"
```

#### C. Push to Repository

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Python not recognized"

**Problem:** Terminal doesn't recognize `python` command.

**Solutions:**

- Try `python3` or `py` instead of `python`
- Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
- Restart terminal after Python installation

---

#### Issue: "No module named 'docx'"

**Problem:** Dependencies not installed.

**Solutions:**

- Ensure virtual environment is activated (see `(venv)` in terminal)
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try `pip3` instead of `pip`

---

#### Issue: "File not found" error

**Problem:** Incorrect file paths in `main.py`.

**Solutions:**

- Check paths are relative to `docx_converter/` folder
- Use forward slashes `/` not backslashes `\`
- Verify files actually exist at specified locations
- Use `../` to go up to project root

---

#### Issue: Figures not extracting

**Problem:** Images missing from converted output.

**Solutions:**

- Verify Word document has embedded images (not linked)
- Ensure images are in correct format (PNG, JPG)
- Check figure style is `RMC_Figure` in Word
- Answer `Y` to "Regenerate figures?" prompt

---

#### Issue: Tables look wrong

**Problem:** Complex tables don't convert correctly.

**Solutions:**

- Simple tables convert automatically
- Complex tables with merged cells may need manual adjustment
- Edit generated `<TableVertical>` components manually
- See [React Components](./08-react-components.mdx) for table examples

---

#### Issue: Equations display as text

**Problem:** Equations not converted to LaTeX.

**Solutions:**

- Check equations use proper Word equation editor (not plain text)
- Manually convert to LaTeX syntax if needed
- Use `<Equation>` component format from [React Components](./08-react-components.mdx)

---

#### Issue: Citations broken

**Problem:** Citations don't link to bibliography.

**Solutions:**

- Verify `bib.json` exists and is complete
- Check citation keys in Word match keys in `bib.json`
- Ensure `BIB_PATH` in `main.py` is correct
- Bibliography must be created **before** conversion

---

#### Issue: Conversion produces errors

**Problem:** Script crashes or reports errors.

**Solutions:**

- Check Word document follows RMC template
