## DOCX to MDX Converter

### Overview

The `docx_to_mdx` Python script is designed to automate the conversion of Microsoft Word (`.docx`) documents using the standard RMC Word Document Template into modular
MDX files, suitable for use with Docusaurus or other React-based documentation systems. It extracts and processes figures, tables, equations, citations, and document
structure, outputting clean, component-rich MDX files and associated assets. This script allows for efficient conversion of existing Word documents into the RMC Software
Documentation site format.

:::warning

**This script will not work if the DOCX file does not follow the standard RMC Word Document Template.**  
Ensure your document is formatted correctly before running the script.

:::

#### File Structure

Below is a typical file structure for the `docx_to_mdx` script, with a brief description of each file’s purpose.

```
docx_to_mdx/
│
├── main.py              # Entry point; orchestrates the DOCX to MDX conversion process.
├── constants.py         # Contains style mappings and global constants for parsing DOCX.
├── helpers.py           # Utility functions for formatting, file operations, JSX/MDX generation, and user prompts.
├── figures.py           # Handles extraction of figures and their captions from DOCX, saves images, and manages figure references.
├── tables.py            # Extracts tables from DOCX, formats them for MDX, and manages table references.
├── citations.py         # Parses citations and bibliography entries, formats them for MDX.
├── equations.py         # Extracts and formats equations and equation references for MDX.
├── docx_processor.py    # Main DOCX parsing logic; splits document into sections, identifies elements, and coordinates extraction.
├── mdx_writer.py        # Writes the processed content (sections, figures, tables, etc.) to MDX files.
├── README.md            # Documentation for the script, usage instructions, and requirements.
```

#### File Descriptions

- **main.py**  
  The main script to run. Handles user prompts, sets up input/output paths, and calls the appropriate modules to process the DOCX and generate MDX files and assets.

- **constants.py**  
  Stores style names, mappings, and other constants used to identify and process elements in the DOCX file (e.g., which styles correspond to headings, figures, tables, etc.).

- **helpers.py**  
  Provides utility functions for formatting text, handling JSX/MDX output, file and directory operations, user confirmations, and other shared logic.

- **figures.py**  
  Contains logic for detecting figures in the DOCX, extracting and saving figure images, parsing and cleaning captions, and generating MDX-compatible figure components and references.

- **tables.py**  
  Handles extraction of tables from the DOCX, formatting them as Markdown or MDX components, and managing table references.

- **citations.py**  
  Parses in-text citations and bibliography entries, formats them for MDX, and links them to the bibliography if provided.

- **equations.py**  
  Extracts equations and equation references from the DOCX, formats them for MDX, and generates appropriate components.

- **docx_processor.py**  
  The core parser that reads the DOCX file, identifies document structure (sections, headings, paragraphs), and coordinates the extraction of figures, tables, equations, and citations.

- **mdx_writer.py**  
  Responsible for writing the processed content to MDX files, organizing sections, and ensuring correct references and imports for assets.

- **README.md**  
  Provides an overview, usage instructions, requirements, and other documentation for users of the script.

### What It Does

1. **Configuration and Setup**

   - The user specifies input and output paths for the DOCX file, bibliography, figures directory, and MDX output directory in `main.py`.
   - The script checks for required dependencies and prompts the user to confirm whether the input variables are set correctly and whether figures should be regenerated within
     the figures folder of the Docusaurus project.

2. **DOCX Parsing**

   - The script loads the DOCX file using `python-docx` and parses the document structure, identifying sections, headings, paragraphs, figures, tables, equations, and citations
     based on style mappings defined in `constants.py`.

3. **Figure Extraction**

   - Figures are detected by their style (e.g., "RMC_Figure").
   - Each figure image is extracted and saved as a PNG file in the specified figures directory.
   - Figure captions are parsed, cleaned, and associated with the correct image.

4. **Table Extraction**

   - Tables are identified and converted into Markdown or MDX table components.
   - Table captions and references are handled and linked appropriately.

5. **Equation and Citation Handling**

   - Inline equations and references are detected and formatted for MDX.
   - Citations are parsed and linked to the provided bibliography file.

6. **Section and Navigation Structure**

   - The script builds a modular section structure, splitting the document into logical MDX files based on headings.
   - Navigation metadata can be generated for Docusaurus sidebars.

7. **MDX File Generation**

   - Each section, figure, table, and equation is written to an MDX file in the output directory.
   - MDX files include custom React components for figures, tables, and references, ready for use in Docusaurus.

8. **Asset Management**
   - All extracted images are saved to the figures directory.
   - Relative paths are set so MDX files can reference images correctly.

### Output

:::tip

The script generates the necessary MDX files and figures to allow the Docusaurus project to build the document. When successful, the document will be in draft form and
ready for review following minor edits.

:::

Outputs include:

- **MDX Files:**  
  Modular `.mdx` files for each section or chapter of the original DOCX, placed in your specified output directory (e.g., `docs/` or `docs/generated/`).
- **Figures:**  
  Extracted figure images as `.png` files, saved in the designated figures directory (e.g., `static/img/figures/`).

### Usage

1. **Assign Input and Output Paths**

   - Open `main.py` in the `scripts/` folder.
   - Set the following variables at the top:
     - `DOCX_PATH`: Path to your input `.docx` file (e.g., `../input/YourDoc.docx`)
     - `BIB_PATH`: Path to your bibliography JSON file (optional)
     - `FIGURES_DIR`: Output directory for extracted figures (e.g., `../static/img/figures`)
     - `MDX_DIR`: Output directory for generated MDX files (e.g., `../docs/generated`)
     - `FIGSRC`: Relative path for figures in MDX (e.g., `/img/figures`)
     - Navigation variables as needed for your Docusaurus sidebar

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
   - Install required packages:
     ```sh
     pip install python-docx pillow python-slugify docx2python
     ```

3. **Run the Script**

   - From your project root or the `scripts/` folder, run:
     ```sh
     npm run convert
     ```
   - The script will prompt you to confirm the following:
     - Whether the input and output variables are set correctly (Y or N). If you choose N, the script will exit.
     - Whether to regenerate figures in the Docusaurus project directory (Y or N). If all figures from the DOCX are already present in the figures directory,
       you can choose not to regenerate them (N). If you choose to regenerate figures (Y), the script will overwrite existing images in the figures directory.

4. **Check Outputs**

   - Find your generated `.mdx` files in the output directory you specified (e.g., `docs/generated/`).
   - Find extracted figure images in the figures directory (e.g., `static/img/figures/`).

5. **Integrate with Docusaurus**

   - The generated MDX files and images are now ready for use in your Docusaurus site.

:::info

This Python script is a preprocessing tool. It is not run by Docusaurus at runtime, but before you build or serve your site.
For troubleshooting, check the console output and review the generated files for formatting or extraction issues.

## **counters.js**

### Overview

The `counters.js` script scans all `.mdx` files in the `docs/` directory, extracts metadata from custom components like `<Figure>`,
`<Table*>`, `<Equation>`, and `<Citation>`, and generates a structured JSON file for each report. These JSON files are stored in
`static/counters/` and contain consistent numbering and metadata for figures, tables, equations, and citations.

### What It Does

- Recursively scans the `docs/` directory for folders containing `.mdx` files.
- Uses `reportIdMap.js` to associate each folder with a unique `reportId`.
- For each matched folder:
  - Parses all `.mdx` files to find:
    - `<Figure figKey="...">` components
    - `<TableHorizontal tableKey="...">`, `<TableVertical>`, or `<TableVerticalLeftAlign>` components
    - `<Equation equationKey="...">` components
    - `<Citation citationKey="...">` components
  - Assigns a unique number to each:
    - `figNumber` for figures
    - `tableNumber` for tables
    - `equationNumber` for equations
    - `citationNumber` for citations
  - Records additional metadata for each:
    - `figKey`, `tableKey`, `equationKey`, or `citationKey`
    - `parentDocId` (from `reportIdMap.js`)
    - `parentDocPath` (relative path within `docs/`)
    - `docId` (name of the `.mdx` file)

### Output

Each output file is saved to: `static/counters/<reportId>.json`. The structure of the JSON output looks like this:

```json
{
  "figures": {
    "figKey": {
      "figNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "soil-erosion",
      "parentDocPath": "rmc/soil/contact-erosion",
      "docId": "overview.mdx"
    }
  },
  "tables": {
    "tableKey": {
      "tableNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "soil-erosion",
      "parentDocPath": "rmc/soil/contact-erosion",
      "docId": "overview.mdx"
    }
  },
  "equations": {
    "equationKey": {
      "equationNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "soil-erosion",
      "parentDocPath": "rmc/soil/contact-erosion",
      "docId": "overview.mdx"
    }
  },
  "citations": {
    "citationKey": {
      "citationNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "internal-erosion-suite-backward-erosion-piping-progression-v1.0",
      "parentDocPath": "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression/v1.0",
      "docId": "04-background.mdx"
    },
  }
}
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required.

During project build, React components like `<Figure>`, `<Table*>`, `<Equation>`, `<Citation>`, `<CitationFootnote>`, and `<Bibliography>` will use the generated
counters JSON files to automatically assign sequential and appropriate numbering to figures, tables, equations, captions, and citations. This relieves the user of the
burden of manually numbering these elements.

## **generateEventTreeToc.js**

:::info Note
This script is only used for the RMC Typical Event Tree Database document.
:::

### Overview

This Node.js script scans the `docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database` directory and generates a versioned table of contents
(`eventTreeToc.json`) in the `src/data/` folder. It organizes `.mdx` files into categories and sub-items based on their numeric filename prefixes and the title found in
each file’s frontmatter.

### What It Does

- Scans each versioned folder (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.4`) under the event tree database directory.
- Filters out `.mdx` files starting with `00`, `01`, or `02`.
- Parses numeric prefixes from filenames:
  - Files ending in `0` (e.g., `030-...`) are treated as **categories**.
  - Files with other prefixes (e.g., `031-...`, `046-...`) are grouped under the most recent category.
- Extracts the `title` value from each file’s frontmatter.
- Builds a versioned TOC object mapping each category to its sub-items.
- Saves the result as a JSON file in `src/data/eventTreeToc.json`.

:::info

If a file does not have a `title` in its frontmatter, the script will fallback to using the filename (with its numeric prefix removed) as the label. This ensures that
each entry has a human-readable label even if metadata is missing.

:::

### Output

The output file (`eventTreeToc.json`) is saved to: `src/data/eventTreeToc.json`

It contains an object with each version and its associated categories and paths. Example:

```json
{
  "v1.4": {
    "Geotechnical Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Generic Internal Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Generic-Internal-Erosion"
      },
    ],
    "Geotechnical Seismic": [
      {
        "label": "Concentrated Leak Erosion (Seismic)",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Concentrated-Leak-Erosion-Seismic"
      },
    ],
    "Spillways Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Unlined Spillway Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Unlined-Spillway-Erosion"
      },
    ],
  },
  "v1.5": {
    "Geotechnical Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Generic Internal Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Generic-Internal-Erosion"
      },
    ],
    "Geotechnical Seismic": [
      {
        "label": "Concentrated Leak Erosion (Seismic)",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Concentrated-Leak-Erosion-Seismic"
      },
    ],
    "Spillways Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Unlined Spillway Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Unlined-Spillway-Erosion"
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required.

## **generateReportIdMap.js**

### Overview

This Node.js script scans the `docs/` folder structure to automatically generate a `reportIdMap.js` file in `src/`. It identifies documentation paths
based on versioned subfolders (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.1`) and builds unique report IDs based on the folder hierarchy.

### What It Does

- Recursively walks the `docs/` directory.
- Identifies folders with names matching a version pattern like `v1.0`, `v2.1`, etc.
- Constructs a unique `reportId` in the format: `<subHub>-<documentName>-<version>`
  - Where:
    - `subHub` is the folder two levels above the version folder
    - `documentName` is the folder directly above the version folder
    - `version` is the version folder name (e.g., `v1.0`)
- Maps the full relative path to the generated report ID.
- Saves the result as an exported JavaScript object in `src/reportIdMap.js`.

:::info

If the folder structure does not contain enough levels (i.e., it lacks a parent document or subHub folder), the script skips that entry and logs a warning.

:::

### Output

The output file (`reportIdMap.js`) is saved to: `src/reportIdMap.js`. It exports an object mapping documentation paths to unique report IDs. The structure looks like this:

```js
// Auto-generated. Do not edit.
const reportIdMap = {
  "desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0": "lifesim-users-guide-v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0": "rmc-bestfit-users-guide-v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0": "rmc-rfa-users-guide-v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0": "rmc-totalrisk-users-guide-v1.0",
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression/v1.0": "internal-erosion-suite-backward-erosion-piping-progression-v1.0",
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/filter-evaluation-continuation/v1.0": "internal-erosion-suite-filter-evaluation-continuation-v1.0",
  "web-applications/lst/users-guide/v1.0": "lst-users-guide-v1.0"
};
module.exports = reportIdMap;
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required. It is used during the build process to
allow React components to reference documentation paths by their unique report IDs.

---

## **generateSidebars.js**

### Overview

This script automatically generates a structured `sidebars.js` file for the RMC Software Documentation Docusaurus site, based on the organization of `.mdx` files
within the `docs/` directory.

### What It Does

- Recursively walks the `docs/` directory to find all `.mdx` files.
- Groups files into categories based on their folder structure.
- Constructs a sidebar structure that follows the standard document layout and naming convention defined in [Docs Folder](docs/00-documentation-guide/04-docs-folder.mdx).
- Generates a `sidebars.js` file that exports a structured object for Docusaurus navigation.

:::tip

This script supports special-case logic for documents that require unique sidebar handling. Contact a site administrator if special-case logic is needed.

:::

### Output

The output file is saved to: `sidebars.js`. It exports an object that defines the sidebar structure for Docusaurus. The structure looks like this:

```js
rmcTotalriskusersGuide_v1_0: {
    "Users Guide": [
      {
        "type": "category",
        "label": "Document Information",
        "collapsible": true,
        "collapsed": true,

            "label": "Appendix A - Acronyms"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required. The generated `sidebars.js` file will be
used by Docusaurus to render the sidebar navigation for the documentation site.

---

## **versions.js**

### Overview

This script scans the `docs/` folder to identify and collect version information. It produces JSON files that list the latest versions available, all available
versions, and generates URLs for use with the Algolia crawler to index the correct documentation versions.

### What It Does

- Defines the base folders where documentation groups live (e.g., "desktop-applications", "toolbox-technical-manuals", "web-applications").
- Recursively walks through these folders to detect version folders that match a pattern like `v1.0`, `v2.3`, etc.
- Identifies the latest version by sorting the version folders descending alphabetically.
- Collects all versions found for each document group.
- Outputs three JSON files: latest version map, full version list, and Algolia crawler URLs.

### Output

- `latestVersions.json`: Contains a mapping of document paths to their latest version folder.

```json
{
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression": "v1.0",
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/filter-evaluation-continuation": "v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide": "v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide": "v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide": "v1.0",
  "web-applications/lst/users-guide": "v1.0"
}
```

- `versionList.json`: Contains a mapping of document paths to all available version folders.

```json
{
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression": [
    "v1.0"
  ],
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/filter-evaluation-continuation": [
    "v1.0"
  ]
}
```

- `algoliaCrawlerVersions.json`: Contains start URLs and discovery patterns based on the latest versions for Algolia's documentation crawler.

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required.

The output JSON files will be saved in the `static/versions` folder.
