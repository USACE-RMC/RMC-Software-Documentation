# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, install the following programs:

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or your preferred Individual Development Environment (IDE)
- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or later)
- Git and/or GitHub Desktop

These instructions are for **U.S. Government (USG)** computers and assume **VS Code** as the IDE.

---

### ‚úÖ Installing VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight code editor used to write, edit, and manage software and documentation projects. It is the
recommended IDE for working on the RMC Software Documentation site.

VS Code is available for request through the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx). It does not require approval, and
installation should occur automatically. If installation doesn‚Äôt begin in the next 48 hours, contact the Enterprise Service Desk at (866) 562-2348.

**Several users have reported issues with VS Code installing correctly onto their USG computers from the App Portal and have required assistance from CIO-G6.**

:::tip Recommended Extension

For improved visual clarity and syntax highlighting when editing `.mdx` files in VS Code, install the **MDX** extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

:::

### ‚úÖ Installing Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime that uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture to support the development of scalable web applications.
The Docusaurus framework used to build the RMC Software Documentation website relies on tools that run on Node.js.

While Node.js is available through the USACE App Portal, it is **recommended** to download it directly from the official Node.js website.

To install Node.js:

1.  On a non-USG computer, download the Standalone Binary (.zip) installation file from the Node.js [Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download). It is recommended
    to download the **LTS** (Long-Term Support) version of the software.

  alt="Download Node.js"
  width="100%"
/>

2.  On your USG computer, create a folder on the `C:` drive named `Portable Software` (or something similar). Place the Node.js zip file in that folder and extract
    the contents.

3.  Add Node.js to your PATH:

- Open the Windows menu and type **environment variables** into the **Search Bar**
- Click on **Edit environment variables for your account**

  - **DO NOT** click on **Edit the system environment variables** ‚Äî that requires admin rights

<FigureNoRef
  src="/figures/documentation-guide/edit-env-variables.png"
  alt="Edit environment variables"
  width="55%"
/>

- In the **Environment Variables** window, select **"Path"** and click **Edit...**

<FigureNoRef
  src="/figures/documentation-guide/edit-user-path.png"
  alt="Edit user PATH"
  width="50%"
/>

- Click **New** and paste the file path for your Node.js folder (e.g., `C:\Portable Software\nodejs`). This should be the folder that holds the **node.exe** file.
- Click **OK** to close the environment variable windows

<FigureNoRef
  src="/figures/documentation-guide/add-to-user-path.png"
  alt="Add Node.js to PATH"
  width="50%"
/>

4.  Confirm installation of Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm):

    - Open **Command Prompt** and type `node --version`
      - If installed correctly, the terminal will return the Node.js version number (e.g., `v22.17.0`).
    - Then type `npm --version`
      - npm is bundled with Node.js and does not require a separate installation. It should return a version number (e.g., `11.4.2`).
    - **NOTE**: The Node.js and npm version numbers will not be the same.

<FigureNoRef
  src="/figures/documentation-guide/installation-check.png"
  alt="Check installation of Node.js and npm"
/>

5.  If either version command fails, ensure that the path to your Node.js folder is correctly entered in the **Environment Variables**. Repeat steps 3‚Äì4 if necessary.

### ‚úÖ Installing Git and GitHub Desktop

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows you to commit updates, create branches, and synchronize
code with shared repositories. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a graphical interface for Git, making it easier to use for contributors who
prefer not to work from the command line.

These tools are required to:

- Download (clone) the RMC Software Documentation repository from GitHub
- Make updates locally on your machine
- Push changes back to GitHub for review and publication

Git and GitHub Desktop are both available for installation from the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx).

To install Git and GitHub Desktop:

<p>
<b><u>1. Request installation from the App Portal</u></b>
</p>

- Open the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx)
- Search for and request the following applications:
  - `Git`
  - `GitHub Desktop`
- Installation should occur automatically. If installation doesn‚Äôt begin in the next 48 hours, contact the Enterprise Service Desk at (866) 562-2348.

<FigureNoRef
  src="/figures/documentation-guide/app-portal-git-items.png"
  alt="USACE App Portal Git and GitHub Desktop"
/>

<p>
<b><u>2. Verify installation</u></b>
</p>

- Open **Command Prompt** and type `git --version`
  - If installed correctly, the terminal will return the Git version number (e.g., `git version 2.42.0.windows.2`).

<FigureNoRef
  src="/figures/documentation-guide/github-desktop-confirm.png"
  alt="GitHub Desktop application confirmation"
/>

- To confirm GitHub Desktop is installed, open the **Windows Start Menu** and search for **GitHub Desktop**. The application should appear in the list.

<FigureNoRef
  src="/figures/documentation-guide/github-desktop-icon.png"
  alt="GitHub Desktop application icon"
  width="55%"
/>

:::info
GitHub Desktop can be used to clone, commit, push, and pull changes to and from the repository without using Git commands directly. However, Git is still required
under the hood, even when using GitHub Desktop.

## Run, Build, and Deploy the Site

### üíª Running Locally

To preview the RMC Software Documentation site on your local machine during development, run:

```powershell
npm run start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the site in your browser.

---

### üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

To generate the optomized static files for deployment, run:

```powershell
npm run build
```

This creates a `build/` directory containing the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. These are suitable for deployment to the GitHub Pages hosting service.

---

### üöÄ Deployment

:::danger Important

Deployment should be coordinated with a site administrator.
Unauthorized deployment may overwrite live documentation.

:::

To deploy the site to **GitHub Pages**, follow these steps:

1. Set the GitHub user environment variable:

   ```powershell
   $env:GIT_USER="USACE-RMC"
   ```

2. Deploy the site:

   ```powershell
   npm run deploy
   ```

This command builds the site and pushes the contents of the `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository using the specified `GIT_USER`.
