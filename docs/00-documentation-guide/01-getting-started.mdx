# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, install the following programs:

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or your preferred Individual Development Environment (IDE)
- Node.js (version 18.0 or later)
- Git and/or GitHub Desktop

These instructions are for **U.S. Government (USG)** computers and assume **VS Code** as the IDE.

---

### ✅ Installing VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight code editor used to write, edit, and manage software and documentation projects. It is the
recommended IDE for working on the RMC Software Documentation site.

VS Code is available for request through the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx). It does not require approval, and
installation should occur automatically. If installation doesn’t begin in the next 48 hours, contact the Enterprise Service Desk at (866) 562-2348.

**Several users have reported issues with VS Code installing correctly onto their USG computers from the App Portal and have required assistance from CIO-G6.**

:::tip Recommended Extension

For improved visual clarity and syntax highlighting when editing `.mdx` files in VS Code, install the **MDX** extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

:::

---

### ✅ Installing Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime that uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture to support the development of scalable web applications.
The Docusaurus framework used to build the RMC Software Documentation website relies on tools that run on Node.js.

While Node.js is available through the USACE App Portal, it is **recommended** to download it directly from the official Node.js website.

To install Node.js:

1.  On a non-USG computer, download the Standalone Binary (.zip) installation file from the Node.js [Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download). It is recommended
    to download the **LTS** (Long-Term Support) version of the software.

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/node-download.png" alt="Download Node.js" width="100%" />

2.  On your USG computer, create a folder on the `C:` drive named `Portable Software` (or similar). Place the Node.js zip file in that folder and extract
    the contents.

3.  Add Node.js to your PATH:

- Open the Windows menu and type **environment variables** into the **Search Bar**
- Click on **Edit environment variables for your account**  
  ❌ **DO NOT** click on **Edit the system environment variables** — that requires admin rights

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/edit-env-variables.png" alt="Edit environment variables" width="55%" />

- In the **Environment Variables** window, select **"Path"** and click **Edit...**

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/edit-user-path.png" alt="Edit user PATH" width="50%" />

- Click **New** and paste the file path for your Node.js folder (e.g., `C:\Portable Software\nodejs`). This should be the folder that holds the **node.exe** file.
- Click **OK** to close the environment variable windows

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/add-to-user-path.png" alt="Add Node.js to PATH" width="50%" />

4.  Confirm installation of Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm):
    - Open **Command Prompt** and type `node --version`
      - If installed correctly, the terminal will return the Node.js version number (e.g., `v18.20.0` or later).
    - Then type `npm --version`
      - npm is bundled with Node.js and does not require a separate installation. It should return a version number (e.g., `10.5.0` or later).
    - **NOTE**: The Node.js and npm version numbers will not be the same. **This project requires Node.js version 18.0 or later.**

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/installation-check.png" alt="Check installation of Node.js and npm" />

5.  If either version command fails, ensure that the path to your Node.js folder is correctly entered in the **Environment Variables**. Repeat steps 3–4 if necessary.

### ✅ Installing Git and GitHub Desktop

Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows you to commit updates, create branches, and synchronize
code with shared repositories. GitHub Desktop provides a graphical interface for Git, making it easier to use for contributors who
prefer not to work from the command line.

These tools are required to:

- Download (clone) the RMC Software Documentation repository from GitHub
- Make updates locally on your machine
- Push changes back to GitHub for review and publication

Git and GitHub Desktop are both available for installation from the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx).

To install Git and GitHub Desktop:

<p>
  <b>
    <u>1. Request installation from the App Portal</u>
  </b>
</p>

- Open the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx)
- Search for and request the following applications:
  - `Git`
  - `GitHub Desktop`
- Installation should occur automatically. If installation doesn’t begin in the next 48 hours, contact the Enterprise Service Desk at (866) 562-2348.

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/app-portal-git-items.png" alt="USACE App Portal Git and GitHub Desktop" />

<p>
  <b>
    <u>2. Verify installation</u>
  </b>
</p>

- Open **Command Prompt** and type `git --version`
  - If installed correctly, the terminal will return the Git version number (e.g., `git version 2.42.0.windows.2`).

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/github-desktop-confirm.png" alt="GitHub Desktop application confirmation" />

- To confirm GitHub Desktop is installed, open the **Windows Start Menu** and search for **GitHub Desktop**. The application should appear in the list.

<FigureNoRef src="/figures/documentation-guide/github-desktop-icon.png" alt="GitHub Desktop application icon" width="55%" />

:::info
GitHub Desktop can be used to clone, commit, push, and pull changes to and from the repository without using Git commands directly. However, Git is still required
under the hood, even when using GitHub Desktop.
:::

---

## GitHub Account and Repository Access

Before you can clone and contribute to the RMC Software Documentation repository, you need to have a GitHub account and appropriate access permissions.

### ✅ Creating a GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account:

1. Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and click **Sign up**
2. Follow the prompts to create your account using your USACE email address
3. Complete email verification
4. Consider enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for security

### ✅ Requesting Collaborator Access

The RMC Software Documentation repository is public, which means anyone can view and clone it. However, to push changes directly to the repository, you must be added as a **collaborator**.

To request collaborator access:

1. Contact the repository administrator, [Adam Gohs](mailto:Adam.C.Gohs@usace.army.mil)
2. Provide your GitHub username
3. Wait for the invitation email from GitHub
4. Accept the collaboration invitation

Once added as a collaborator, you'll be able to:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Create and switch between branches
- Commit and push changes directly to the repository
- Participate in code reviews and pull requests

:::info Alternative: Fork and Pull Request Workflow

If you are an external contributor or prefer not to request collaborator access, you can:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Make changes in your fork
4. Submit a **pull request** back to the main `USACE-RMC/RMC-Software-Documentation` repository

This workflow is common for open-source projects but requires additional steps. For internal RMC team members, collaborator access is recommended.

## Cloning the Project

To begin working on the RMC Software Documentation website, you'll first need to clone the project repository to your local machine and install the required
dependencies.

:::tip Recommended Repository Location

It is recommended to store cloned Git repositories in a **dedicated folder** on your local machine, such as `C:\GitHub` or `C:\Projects`. This helps with organization when working with multiple repositories.

**⚠️ Avoid OneDrive-synced locations** for Git repositories. Cloning to a OneDrive folder can cause:

- **Sync conflicts**: OneDrive may try to sync files while Git is modifying them, potentially causing corruption
- **Performance issues**: Development tools and file watchers can be slowed by continuous OneDrive syncing
- **Lock conflicts**: OneDrive might lock files that Git or your IDE needs to access
- **Large folder sync problems**: Projects often contain thousands of small files (e.g., `node_modules/`, `.git/`) that can overwhelm OneDrive

Choose a location on your local drive (e.g., `C:\GitHub`) that is **not** synced to OneDrive, SharePoint, or other cloud storage services.

## Run, Build, and Deploy the Site

### 💻 Running Locally

To preview the RMC Software Documentation site on your local machine during development, run:

```powershell
npm run start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically reload the site in your browser.

---

### 🚀 Deployment (Admin-Level Only)

:::danger Important

**Deployment is an administrator-level task.** Contributors should focus on creating and editing documentation content using `npm start` for local testing. Site administrators will handle all building and deployment to production.

**Contributors do NOT need to run `npm run build` or `npm run deploy`.** If you encounter any issues while testing locally with `npm start`, contact the repository administrator rather than attempting to troubleshoot build processes.

Unauthorized deployment may overwrite live documentation and disrupt the website.

:::

<details>
<summary><b>For Site Administrators Only: Deployment Instructions</b></summary>

If you are a site administrator deploying to **GitHub Pages**, follow these steps:

1. **Build the site for production:**

   ```powershell
   npm run build
   ```

   This creates a `build/` directory containing optimized static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

2. **Test the production build locally:**

   ```powershell
   npx serve build
   ```

   This serves the production build locally (typically at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5000`).

   **Important:** Verify that:
   - All pages load correctly
   - Navigation works as expected
   - Images and static assets display properly
   - Links are not broken
   - No console errors appear

   Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server when testing is complete.

3. **Set the GitHub user environment variable:**

   ```powershell
   $env:GIT_USER="USACE-RMC"
   ```

4. **Deploy the site:**

   ```powershell
   npm run deploy
   ```

   This command builds the site again (to ensure the latest changes) and pushes the contents of the `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository using the specified `GIT_USER`.

   :::tip
   Note that `npm run deploy` automatically runs the build process, so technically step 1 is redundant if you skip testing. However, testing the production build before deployment (steps 1-2) is **strongly recommended** to catch any production-specific issues before they go live.

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

### Node.js Not Recognized

**Problem:** Running `node --version` returns "command not found" or similar error.

**Solutions:**

- Verify that Node.js is installed in the correct location (e.g., `C:\Portable Software\nodejs`)
- Check that the Node.js folder path is correctly added to your PATH environment variable
- **Restart Command Prompt** after adding to PATH (changes don't take effect in open terminals)

### npm install Fails

**Problem:** Running `npm install` produces errors or fails to complete.

**Solutions:**

- Ensure Node.js version is 18.0 or later (`node --version`)
- Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then try `npm install` again
- Check your internet connection (npm needs to download packages)
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`, then try again

### Dev Server Won't Start

**Problem:** Running `npm start` produces errors or doesn't launch the development server.

**Solutions:**

- Ensure you've run `npm install` successfully first
- Check that port 3000 isn't already in use by another application
- Clear the Docusaurus cache: `npm run clear`, then try `npm start` again
- Delete the `.docusaurus` folder manually, then try again
- Review error messages carefully - they often indicate missing dependencies or configuration issues

### VS Code Installation Issues

**Problem:** VS Code doesn't install automatically from USACE App Portal.

**Solutions:**

- Wait 48 hours after requesting from the App Portal
- Check the Software Center application for installation status
- Contact Enterprise Service Desk at (866) 562-2348
- As noted in the installation section, several users have required CIO-G6 assistance for VS Code installation
