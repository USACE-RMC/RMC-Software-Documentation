# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, install the following programs:

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or your preferred Individual Development Environment (IDE)
- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or later)
- Git and/or GitHub Desktop

These instructions are for **U.S. Government (USG)** computers and assume **VS Code** as the IDE.

---

### ✅ Installing VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight code editor used to write, edit, and manage software and documentation projects. It is the
recommended IDE for working on the RMC Software Documentation site.

VS Code is available for request through the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx). It does not require approval, and
installation should occur automatically. If installation doesn’t begin in the next 48 hours, contact the Enterprise Service Desk at (866) 562-2348.

:::warning
Several users have reported issues with VS Code installing correctly onto their USG computers from the App Portal and have required assistance from CIO-G6.

### ✅ Installing Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime that uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture to support the development of scalable web applications.
The Docusaurus framework used to build the RMC Software Documentation website relies on tools that run on Node.js.

While Node.js is available through the USACE App Portal, it is **recommended** to download it directly from the official Node.js website.

To install Node.js:

1. On a non-USG computer, download the Standalone Binary (.zip) installation file from the Node.js [Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).  
   It is recommended to download the **LTS** (Long-Term Support) version of the software.

   <FigureNoRef
     src="/figures/documentation-guide/node-download.png"
     alt="Download Node.js"
     width="100%"
   />

2. On your USG computer, create a folder on the `C:` drive named `Portable Software` (or something similar). Place the Node.js zip file in that folder and extract
   the contents.

3. Add Node.js to your PATH:

   - Open the Windows menu and type **environment variables** into the **Search Bar**
   - Click on **Edit environment variables for your account**

     - **DO NOT** click on **Edit the system environment variables** — that requires admin rights

     <FigureNoRef
       src="/figures/documentation-guide/edit-env-variables.png"
       alt="Edit environment variables"
       width="55%"
     />

   - In the **Environment Variables** window, select **"Path"** and click **Edit...**

     <FigureNoRef
       src="/figures/documentation-guide/edit-user-path.png"
       alt="Edit user PATH"
       width="50%"
     />

   - Click **New** and paste the file path for your Node.js folder (e.g., `C:\Portable Software\nodejs`). This should be the folder that holds the **node.exe** file.
   - Click **OK** to close the environment variable windows

     <FigureNoRef
       src="/figures/documentation-guide/add-to-user-path.png"
       alt="Add Node.js to PATH"
       width="50%"
     />

4. Confirm installation of Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm):

   - Open **Command Prompt** and type `node --version`
     - If installed correctly, the terminal will return the Node.js version number (e.g., `v22.17.0`).
   - Then type `npm --version`
     - npm is bundled with Node.js and does not require a separate installation. It should return a version number (e.g., `11.4.2`).
   - **NOTE**: The Node.js and npm version numbers will not be the same.

   <FigureNoRef
     src="/figures/documentation-guide/installation-check.png"
     alt="Check installation of Node.js and npm"
   />

5. If either version command fails, ensure that the path to your Node.js folder is correctly entered in the **Environment Variables**. Repeat steps 3–4 if necessary.

### ✅ Installing Git and GitHub Desktop

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows you to commit updates, create branches, and synchronize
code with shared repositories. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a graphical interface for Git, making it easier to use for contributors who
prefer not to work from the command line.

These tools are required to:

- Download (clone) the RMC Software Documentation repository from GitHub
- Make updates locally on your machine
- Push changes back to GitHub for review and publication

Git and GitHub Desktop are both available for installation from the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx).

To install Git and GitHub Desktop:

1. Request installation from the App Portal:

   - Open the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx)
   - Search for and request the following applications:
     - `Git`
     - `GitHub Desktop`
   - Installation should occur automatically. If installation doesn’t begin in the next 48 hours, contact the Enterprise Service Desk at (866) 562-2348.

   <FigureNoRef
     src="/figures/documentation-guide/app-portal-git-items.png"
     alt="USACE App Portal Git and GitHub Desktop"
   />

2. Verify installation:

   - Open **Command Prompt** and type `git --version`

     - If installed correctly, the terminal will return the Git version number (e.g., `git version 2.42.0.windows.2`).

   <FigureNoRef
     src="/figures/documentation-guide/github-desktop-confirm.png"
     alt="GitHub Desktop application confirmation"
   />

   - To confirm GitHub Desktop is installed, open the **Windows Start Menu** and search for **GitHub Desktop**. The application should appear in the list.

   <FigureNoRef
     src="/figures/documentation-guide/github-desktop-icon.png"
     alt="GitHub Desktop application icon"
     width="55%"
   />

:::info
GitHub Desktop can be used to clone, commit, push, and pull changes to and from the repository without using Git commands directly. However, Git is still required
under the hood, even when using GitHub Desktop.
