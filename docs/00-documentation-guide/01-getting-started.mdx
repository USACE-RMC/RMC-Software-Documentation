# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=14.0.0)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.22.0)

You can verify Node.js and npm installation by running:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

## Cloning the Project

### Clone the Repository

If you havenâ€™t already, clone the RMC Software Documentation Docusaurus project repository to your local machine:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RMC-Software-Documentation.git
```

Or use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository to your local machine.

### Change into the Project Directory

```powershell
cd RMC-Software-Documentation
```

Or use GitHub Desktop to open the RMC-Software-Documentation project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository and navigated to the project directory, install the required dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

This will install all necessary packages to edit, test, build, and deploy the Docusaurus project.

## Running Locally

To run the Docusaurus site locally, use:

```powershell
npm run start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`, and any changes you make will be reflected immediately in the browser.

## Building for Production

To build the Docusaurus site for production, use:

```powershell
npm run build
```

This will generate the static files in the `build/` folder. These files are ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Deployment

To deploy the Docusaurus site on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Set the `GIT_USER` environment variable:

   ```powershell
   $env:GIT_USER="USACE-RMC"
   ```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:

   ```powershell
   npm run deploy
   ```
