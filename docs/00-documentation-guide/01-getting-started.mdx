# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

:::danger

If you are using a U.S. Government (USG) computer you may not be able to download the Node.js package directly from the website.
Skip to the "Instructions on U.S. Government Computer" section below.

:::

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=14.0.0)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.22.0)

You can verify Node.js and npm installation by running:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

### Instructions on U.S. Government Computer

To install and use Node.js, follow these instructions:

1. Using an external hard drive and a non-USG computer, download the Standalone Binary (.zip) installation file from the Node.js website.

2. On your USG computer, create a file on the C: drive labeled "Portable Software" or similar. Place the Node.js zip file into that folder and extract the contents.

3. Add Node.js to your USG computer's PATH.

   - Open the Windows menu and type "Environment Variables"
   - Click on "Edit environment variables for your account"
   - In the Environment Variables window, select "Path" and click "Edit..."
   - Click "New" and paste the file path for your Node.js folder (e.g. "C:\Portable Software\nodejs")
   - Click "OK" to close the Edit environment variable window and click "OK" to close the Environment Variables window

4. Open Command Prompt and type "node -v" to confirm that Node.js is installed. You should see the Node.js version number in the Command Prompt window.

## Cloning the Project

### Clone the Repository

If you havenâ€™t already, clone the RMC Software Documentation Docusaurus project repository to your local machine:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RMC-Software-Documentation.git
```

Or use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository to your local machine.

### Change into the Project Directory

```powershell
cd RMC-Software-Documentation
```

Or use GitHub Desktop to open the RMC-Software-Documentation project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository and navigated to the project directory, install the required dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

This will install all necessary packages to edit, test, build, and deploy the Docusaurus project.

## Running Locally

To run the Docusaurus site locally, use:

```powershell
npm run start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`, and any changes you make will be reflected immediately in the browser.

## Building for Production

To build the Docusaurus site for production, use:

```powershell
npm run build
```

This will generate the static files in the `build/` folder. These files are ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Deployment
