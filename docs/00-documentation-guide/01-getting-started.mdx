# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need to install the following programs on your computer:

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or your preferred Individual Development Environment (IDE)
- Node.js (>=14.0.0)

Installation instructions for these programs vary based on whether you are using a U.S. Government (USG) computer. The following sections provide installation instructions
for [USG](#us-government-computer-installation-instructions) and [non-USG](#non-us-government-computer-installation-instructions) computers.

### U.S. Government Computer Installation Instructions

These instructions assume that VS Code is used as the preferred IDE.

#### VS Code

VS Code is available for request through the [USACE App Portal](https://usace.dps.mil/sites/CIOG6-SS/SitePages/App-Portal.aspx). It does not require approval and installation
should occur automatically. More information on VS Code can be found on the software's [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

:::warning

Several users have reported issues with VS Code installing correctly onto their USG computers from the App Portal and have required assistance from CIO-G6.

:::

#### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime designed to build scalable network applications. The Docusaurus framework for the RMC Software
Documentation website is built using Node.js-based tools.

Node.js is available for download from the App Portal (not recommended at this time) or directly from the Node.js website (recommended at this time). To install Node.js from the
website:

1. Using an external hard drive and a non-USG computer, download the Standalone Binary (.zip) installation file from the Node.js [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download). It
   is recommended to download the **LTS** (Long-Term Support) version of the software.

2. On your USG computer, create a file on the C: drive labeled "Portable Software" or similar. Place the Node.js zip file into that folder and extract the contents.

3. Add Node.js to your USG computer's PATH.

   - Open the Windows menu and type **"Environment Variables"**
   - Click on **"Edit environment variables for your account"**
   - In the Environment Variables window, select **"Path"** and click **"Edit..."**
   - Click **"New"** and paste the file path for your Node.js folder (e.g. "C:\Portable Software\nodejs")
   - Click <b>"OK"</b> to close the Edit environment variable window and click <b>"OK"</b> to close the Environment Variables window

4. Confirm Node.js installation by opening Command Prompt and typing `node --version`. If installed correctly, the Command Prompt terminal will return the
   Node.js version number (e.g., 22.17.0).

5. Confirm installation of Node Package Manager (npm) by typing `npm --version` into the same Command Prompt window. Node Package Manager is bundled with Node.js
   and does not require a separate installation. If successfully intalled, the Command Prompt terminal will return the npm version number (e.g., 11.4.2).

:::info NOTE
The Node.js and npm version numbers will not be the same.
:::

6. If version numbers for Node.js and npm are returned in the Command Prompt terminal, installation was successful. If the Command Prompt terminal returns an error, ensure that
   the location of the Node.js executable file is correctly entered into your USG computer's PATH by repeating items 3-5.

:::warning
Node.js MUST be installed before running **"npm install"** or other Node.js-based commands. If not installed, an error will be returned.

### Non U.S. Governement Computer Installation Instructions

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

You can verify Node.js and npm installation by running:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

## Cloning the Project

### Clone the Repository

If you havenâ€™t already, clone the RMC Software Documentation Docusaurus project repository to your local machine:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RMC-Software-Documentation.git
```

Or use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository to your local machine.

### Change into the Project Directory

```powershell
cd RMC-Software-Documentation
```

Or use GitHub Desktop to open the RMC-Software-Documentation project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository and navigated to the project directory, install the required dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

This will install all necessary packages to edit, test, build, and deploy the Docusaurus project.

## Running Locally

To run the Docusaurus site locally, use:

```powershell
npm run start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`, and any changes you make will be reflected immediately in the browser.

## Building for Production

To build the Docusaurus site for production, use:

```powershell
npm run build
```

This will generate the static files in the `build/` folder. These files are ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.

## Deployment

:::danger

**Note:** Deployment of the project should be done carefully.
Check with a site administrator prior to deploying the project.

:::

To deploy the Docusaurus site on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Set the `GIT_USER` environment variable:

   ```powershell
   $env:GIT_USER="USACE-RMC"
   ```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:

   ```powershell
   npm run deploy
   ```
