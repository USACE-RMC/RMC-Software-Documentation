# Scripts Folder

The `scripts/` folder contains custom Node.js scripts for automation and data generation in the RMC Software Documentation project.

---

## **counters.js**

### Overview

The `counters.js` script scans all `.mdx` files in the `docs/` directory, extracts metadata from custom components like `<Figure>`,
`<Table*>`, `<Equation>`, and `<Citation>`, and generates a structured JSON file for each report. These JSON files are stored in
`static/counters/` and contain consistent numbering and metadata for figures, tables, equations, and citations.

### What It Does

- Recursively scans the `docs/` directory for folders containing `.mdx` files.
- Uses `reportIdMap.js` to associate each folder with a unique `reportId`.
- For each matched folder:
  - Parses all `.mdx` files to find:
    - `<Figure figKey="...">` components
    - `<TableHorizontal tableKey="...">`, `<TableVertical>`, or `<TableVerticalLeftAlign>` components
    - `<Equation equationKey="...">` components
    - `<Citation citationKey="...">` components
  - Assigns a unique number to each:
    - `figNumber` for figures
    - `tableNumber` for tables
    - `equationNumber` for equations
    - `citationNumber` for citations
  - Records additional metadata for each:
    - `figKey`, `tableKey`, `equationKey`, or `citationKey`
    - `parentDocId` (from `reportIdMap.js`)
    - `parentDocPath` (relative path within `docs/`)
    - `docId` (name of the `.mdx` file)

### Output

Each output file is saved to: `static/counters/<reportId>.json`. The structure of the JSON output looks like this:

```json
{
  "figures": {
    "figKey": {
      "figNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "soil-erosion",
      "parentDocPath": "rmc/soil/contact-erosion",
      "docId": "overview.mdx"
    }
  },
  "tables": {
    "tableKey": {
      "tableNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "soil-erosion",
      "parentDocPath": "rmc/soil/contact-erosion",
      "docId": "overview.mdx"
    }
  },
  "equations": {
    "equationKey": {
      "equationNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "soil-erosion",
      "parentDocPath": "rmc/soil/contact-erosion",
      "docId": "overview.mdx"
    }
  },
  "citations": {
    "citationKey": {
      "citationNumber": 1,
      "parentDocId": "internal-erosion-suite-backward-erosion-piping-progression-v1.0",
      "parentDocPath": "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression/v1.0",
      "docId": "04-background.mdx"
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required.

During project build, React components like `<Figure>`, `<Table*>`, `<Equation>`, `<Citation>`, `<CitationFootnote>`, and `<Bibliography>` will use the generated
counters JSON files to automatically assign sequential and appropriate numbering to figures, tables, equations, captions, and citations. This relieves the user of the
burden of manually numbering these elements.

## **generateEventTreeToc.js**

:::info Note
This script is only used for the RMC Typical Event Tree Database document.
:::

### Overview

This Node.js script scans the `docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database` directory and generates a versioned table of contents
(`eventTreeToc.json`) in the `src/data/` folder. It organizes `.mdx` files into categories and sub-items based on their numeric filename prefixes and the title found in
each file’s frontmatter.

### What It Does

- Scans each versioned folder (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.4`) under the event tree database directory.
- Filters out `.mdx` files starting with `00`, `01`, or `02`.
- Parses numeric prefixes from filenames:
  - Files ending in `0` (e.g., `030-...`) are treated as **categories**.
  - Files with other prefixes (e.g., `031-...`, `046-...`) are grouped under the most recent category.
- Extracts the `title` value from each file’s frontmatter.
- Builds a versioned TOC object mapping each category to its sub-items.
- Saves the result as a JSON file in `src/data/eventTreeToc.json`.

:::info

If a file does not have a `title` in its frontmatter, the script will fallback to using the filename (with its numeric prefix removed) as the label. This ensures that
each entry has a human-readable label even if metadata is missing.

:::

### Output

The output file (`eventTreeToc.json`) is saved to: `src/data/eventTreeToc.json`

It contains an object with each version and its associated categories and paths. Example:

```json
{
  "v1.4": {
    "Geotechnical Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Generic Internal Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Generic-Internal-Erosion"
      }
    ],
    "Geotechnical Seismic": [
      {
        "label": "Concentrated Leak Erosion (Seismic)",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Concentrated-Leak-Erosion-Seismic"
      }
    ],
    "Spillways Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Unlined Spillway Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Unlined-Spillway-Erosion"
      }
    ]
  },
  "v1.5": {
    "Geotechnical Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Generic Internal Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Generic-Internal-Erosion"
      }
    ],
    "Geotechnical Seismic": [
      {
        "label": "Concentrated Leak Erosion (Seismic)",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Concentrated-Leak-Erosion-Seismic"
      }
    ],
    "Spillways Hydrologic": [
      {
        "label": "Unlined Spillway Erosion",
        "path": "/docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/risk-calculations-suite/typical-event-tree-database/v1.0/Unlined-Spillway-Erosion"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required.

## **generateReportIdMap.js**

### Overview

This Node.js script scans the `docs/` folder structure to automatically generate a `reportIdMap.js` file in `src/`. It identifies documentation paths
based on versioned subfolders (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.1`) and builds unique report IDs based on the folder hierarchy.

### What It Does

- Recursively walks the `docs/` directory.
- Identifies folders with names matching a version pattern like `v1.0`, `v2.1`, etc.
- Constructs a unique `reportId` in the format: `<subHub>-<documentName>-<version>`
  - Where:
    - `subHub` is the folder two levels above the version folder
    - `documentName` is the folder directly above the version folder
    - `version` is the version folder name (e.g., `v1.0`)
- Maps the full relative path to the generated report ID.
- Saves the result as an exported JavaScript object in `src/reportIdMap.js`.

:::info

If the folder structure does not contain enough levels (i.e., it lacks a parent document or subHub folder), the script skips that entry and logs a warning.

:::

### Output

The output file (`reportIdMap.js`) is saved to: `src/reportIdMap.js`. It exports an object mapping documentation paths to unique report IDs. The structure looks like this:

```js
// Auto-generated. Do not edit.
const reportIdMap = {
  "desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0": "lifesim-users-guide-v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0":
    "rmc-bestfit-users-guide-v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0": "rmc-rfa-users-guide-v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0":
    "rmc-totalrisk-users-guide-v1.0",
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression/v1.0":
    "internal-erosion-suite-backward-erosion-piping-progression-v1.0",
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/filter-evaluation-continuation/v1.0":
    "internal-erosion-suite-filter-evaluation-continuation-v1.0",
  "web-applications/lst/users-guide/v1.0": "lst-users-guide-v1.0",
};
module.exports = reportIdMap;
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required. It is used during the build process to
allow React components to reference documentation paths by their unique report IDs.

## **generateSidebars.js**

### Overview

This script automatically generates a structured `sidebars.js` file for the RMC Software Documentation Docusaurus site, based on the organization of `.mdx` files
within the `docs/` directory.

### What It Does

- Recursively walks the `docs/` directory to find all `.mdx` files.
- Groups files into categories based on their folder structure.
- Constructs a sidebar structure that follows the standard document layout and naming convention defined in [Docs Folder](docs/00-documentation-guide/05-docs-folder.mdx).
- Generates a `sidebars.js` file that exports a structured object for Docusaurus navigation.

:::tip

This script supports special-case logic for documents that require unique sidebar handling. Contact a site administrator if special-case logic is needed.

:::

### Output

The output file is saved to: `sidebars.js`. It exports an object that defines the sidebar structure for Docusaurus. The structure looks like this:

```js
rmcTotalriskusersGuide_v1_0: {
    "Users Guide": [
      {
        "type": "category",
        "label": "Document Information",
        "collapsible": true,
        "collapsed": true,
        "items": [
          {
            "type": "doc",
            "id": "desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/document-info",
            "label": "Document Info"
          },
          {

          },
          {
            "type": "doc",
            "id": "desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/welcome",
            "label": "Welcome to RMC-TotalRisk"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "category",
        "label": "Appendices",
        "collapsible": true,
        "collapsed": true,
        "items": [
          {
            "type": "doc",
            "id": "desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/appendix-acronyms",
            "label": "Appendix A - Acronyms"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
```

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required. The generated `sidebars.js` file will be
used by Docusaurus to render the sidebar navigation for the documentation site.

## **versions.js**

### Overview

This script scans the `docs/` folder to identify and collect version information. It produces JSON files that list the latest versions available, all available
versions, and generates URLs for use with the Algolia crawler to index the correct documentation versions.

### What It Does

- Defines the base folders where documentation groups live (e.g., "desktop-applications", "toolbox-technical-manuals", "web-applications").
- Recursively walks through these folders to detect version folders that match a pattern like `v1.0`, `v2.3`, etc.
- Identifies the latest version by sorting the version folders descending alphabetically.
- Collects all versions found for each document group.
- Outputs three JSON files: latest version map, full version list, and Algolia crawler URLs.

### Output

- `latestVersions.json`: Contains a mapping of document paths to their latest version folder.

```json
{
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression": "v1.0",
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/filter-evaluation-continuation": "v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide": "v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide": "v1.0",
  "desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide": "v1.0",
  "web-applications/lst/users-guide": "v1.0"
}
```

- `versionList.json`: Contains a mapping of document paths to all available version folders.

```json
{
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/backward-erosion-piping-progression": [
    "v1.0"
  ],
  "toolbox-technical-manuals/internal-erosion-suite/filter-evaluation-continuation": [
    "v1.0"
  ]
}
```

- `algoliaCrawlerVersions.json`: Contains start URLs and discovery patterns based on the latest versions for Algolia's documentation crawler.

### Usage

This script is automatically run on project start, build, and deploy. No additional execution of this script is required.

The output JSON files will be saved in the `static/versions` folder.
