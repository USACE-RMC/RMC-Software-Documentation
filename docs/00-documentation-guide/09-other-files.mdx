## Project Dependencies

- **`package.json`**  
  Lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata.  
  Defines the required versions of packages needed to run or build the documentation site, and includes custom scripts like `counters`, `versions`, `run`, `start`, `build`, and `deploy` for Docusaurus.

- **`package-lock.json`**  
  Locks the exact versions of every package (and sub-package) installed at the time of `npm install`.  
  Ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same dependency versions, which improves consistency across environments.

## `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`

- **`.gitignore`**  
  Specifies files and folders that should be excluded from version control (e.g., `node_modules/`, build artifacts, local environment files).

- **`.gitattributes`**  
  Used to define attributes per path, such as end-of-line normalization and diff settings.

## `.nojekyll`

This file tells GitHub Pages to bypass Jekyll processing, allowing files and folders that start with an underscore (`_`) to be served.

---

## `README.md`

Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and a summary of the documentation structure.  
It is intended for developers and contributors working with the repository.

---

## `sidebars.js`

Exports the navigation structure used for the documents within the project.  
This file is automatically generated by the `generateSidebars.js` script and organizes documents into categories and subcategories with collapsible navigation items for the Docusaurus sidebar.

For more details, see the [sidebars.js documentation](./08-sidebars.mdx).
