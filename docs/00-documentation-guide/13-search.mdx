# Search

This project uses **Algolia**, a powerful hosted search engine that delivers instant, full-text search results as you type. It's designed for speed, scalability, and relevance.

When integrated with **Docusaurus**, Algolia provides a seamless search experience through its **DocSearch** service. DocSearch crawls and indexes your Docusaurus site, allowing users to quickly find relevant content across all pages and documentation versions.

---

## How It Works

- Algolia’s crawler automatically scans your site at regular intervals.
- Indexed content is stored in Algolia’s search backend.
- A lightweight, customizable search UI (provided by DocSearch) is embedded in your Docusaurus site.
- Users can search titles, content, headers, and metadata with fast, accurate results.

## Configuration

The Algolia search integration is configured in your `docusaurus.config.js` file under the `themeConfig.algolia` section.  
The following information has been entered from the RMC Software Documentation project's Algolia account:

- **appId**: Your Algolia application ID
- **apiKey**: Public API key (search-only)
- **indexName**: The name of your Algolia index

Current configuration:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
themeConfig: {
  algolia: {
    appId: "5IPYQGAW1I",
    apiKey: "797fecb09f4d22f8050f47976027c58c",
    indexName: "usace-rmcio",
  }
```

## Indexing and Versioning

The `scripts/versions.js` script generates JSON files in `static/versions/` to help Algolia index the correct documentation versions.  
Algolia’s crawler uses these files to determine which URLs to index and how to handle versioned docs.

---

## Usage

The search bar appears at the top of every documentation page.  
Start typing to see instant results from all indexed content.

Results include:

- Page titles
- Headings
- Content snippets

These features enable quick navigation across the site.

## Security

:::danger IMPORTANT
The API Key displayed above is the search API key, safe for public repository. Never expose the project's **Algolia Admin API Key** in
public repositories or in any client-side code.
