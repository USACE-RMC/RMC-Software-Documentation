# Search

This project uses **Algolia**, a powerful hosted search engine that delivers instant, full-text search results as you type. It's designed for speed, scalability, and relevance.

When integrated with **Docusaurus**, Algolia provides a seamless search experience through its **DocSearch** service. DocSearch crawls and indexes your Docusaurus site, allowing users to quickly find relevant content across all pages and documentation versions.

---

## How It Works

- Algolia’s crawler automatically scans your site at regular intervals.
- Indexed content is stored in Algolia’s search backend.
- A lightweight, customizable search UI (provided by DocSearch) is embedded in your Docusaurus site.
- Users can search titles, content, headers, and metadata with fast, accurate results.

---

## Configuration

The Algolia search integration is configured in your `docusaurus.config.js` file under the `themeConfig.algolia` section.  
You will need the following information from your Algolia account:

- **appId**: Your Algolia application ID
- **apiKey**: Public API key (search-only)
- **indexName**: The name of your Algolia index

Example configuration:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
themeConfig: {
  algolia: {
    appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY',
    indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME',
    contextualSearch: true,
    // ...other options
  },
}
```

---

## Indexing and Versioning

The `scripts/versions.js` script generates JSON files in `static/versions/` to help Algolia index the correct documentation versions.  
Algolia’s crawler uses these files to determine which URLs to index and how to handle versioned docs.

---

## Usage

The search bar appears at the top of every documentation page.  
Start typing to see instant results from all indexed content.

Results include:

- Page titles
- Headings
- Content snippets

These features enable quick navigation across the site.

## Security

> **⚠️ Important:** Never expose your **Algolia Admin API Key** in public repositories or in any client-side code.  
> Use only the **search-only API key** in your Docusaurus configuration.

## Credentials

The password for Algolia for this project is:

> For security best practices, avoid committing any API keys or passwords directly into source code. Consider using environment variables or a separate secrets configuration for production deployments.
