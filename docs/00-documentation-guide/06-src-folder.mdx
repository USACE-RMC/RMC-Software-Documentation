# The `src/` Folder

The `src/` folder contains all source code for custom React components, styles, pages, and theme files used in the RMC Software Documentation project.

## Subfolders and Key Files

- **components/**  
  Contains all custom React components used throughout the documentation site.  
  Examples include:

  - `Bibliography.js`
  - `Citation.js`
  - `CitationFootnote.js`
  - `DocumentMetadata.js`
  - `Equation.js`
  - `Figure.js`
  - `NavContainer.js`
  - `TableAcronyms.js`
  - ...and more

- **contexts/**  
  Contains React context files for state management and sharing data (such as `ReportIdContext.js`).

- **css/**  
  Custom CSS files for styling the documentation site and components.

  - `custom.css` contains global styles.
  - Other CSS files are specific to individual components.

- **pages/**  
  Custom web pages such as the website home page, hubs, sub-hubs, and index pages.

  - `index.js`: The home page for the RMC Software Documentation website.

- **theme/**  
  Custom theme-related files for Docusaurus, allowing you to override or extend the default theme.

- **reportIdMap.js**  
  This auto-generated file exports a mapping of documentation base paths (including version) to unique report IDs.  
  **Do not edit this file manually; it is regenerated as needed by scripts.**

- **draftDocs.js**  
  Aggregates all document entries from each navigation/category file and exports an array (`draftDocs`) containing the base paths of all documents marked as `draft: true`.  
  Used by theme components to determine if a documentation page should display a DRAFT watermark.

## Best Practices

- Place all reusable React components in the `components/` folder.
- Use the `contexts/` folder for any shared React context logic.
- Keep global and component-specific styles organized in the `css/` folder.
- Only modify `reportIdMap.js` and `draftDocs.js` through the appropriate scripts; do not edit them manually.
- Use the `theme/` folder to customize or extend Docusaurus theme functionality.
