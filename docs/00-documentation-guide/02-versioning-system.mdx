title: Versioning System

# Versioning System

The RMC Software Documentation site uses a structured versioning system to maintain clarity and transparency as documentation evolves. This system helps both contributors and readers track significant updates to documentation over time.

## Version Format: Major.Minor

All documentation versions follow a **Major.Minor** structure (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v2.0`).

---

## When to Create a New Version

### Major Version (X.0)

Create a new major version when making significant changes:

**Indicators for Major Version:**

- Adding or removing entire chapters
- Major restructuring of document organization
- Updating documentation for new software major release
- Substantial rewrites affecting multiple chapters
- Significant changes to document scope or audience

**Examples:**

- `v1.0` → `v2.0`: Software updated from version 1.x to 2.x with new features
- `v1.0` → `v2.0`: Added three new chapters covering new functionality
- `v1.0` → `v2.0`: Completely restructured user guide organization

### Minor Version (X.Y)

Create a new minor version for targeted updates:

**Indicators for Minor Version:**

- Expanding existing sections with new material
- Rewriting sections for improved clarity
- Adding new subsections or examples to existing chapters
- Updating screenshots or figures for minor software updates
- Adding new procedures or workflows

**Examples:**

- `v1.0` → `v1.1`: Updated Chapter 3 with expanded troubleshooting section
- `v1.1` → `v1.2`: Added new examples to installation guide
- `v1.2` → `v1.3`: Rewrote data import procedures for clarity

### Updates Without New Version

Some changes don't require a new version:

**No Version Change Needed:**

- Fixing typos or grammatical errors
- Correcting broken links
- Formatting adjustments
- Minor word changes for clarity
- Updating contact information
- Fixing image alignment or sizing

**Key Principle:** If the change doesn't affect the user's understanding or use of the software, it typically doesn't need a new version.

## Version Folder Structure

Each version is stored in its own folder within the documentation structure:

```
docs/
└── software-name/
    ├── v1.0/              ← Version folder
    │   ├── 01-intro.mdx
    │   ├── 02-install.mdx
    │   └── 03-usage.mdx
    ├── v1.1/              ← New minor version
    │   ├── 01-intro.mdx
    │   ├── 02-install.mdx
    │   └── 03-usage.mdx   (updated content)
    └── v2.0/              ← New major version
        ├── 01-intro.mdx
        ├── 02-install.mdx
        ├── 03-usage.mdx
        └── 04-advanced.mdx  (new chapter)
```

**Key Points:**

- Each version folder contains a complete copy of all documentation files
- Users can switch between versions using the version selector
- All versions remain accessible on the site
- Older versions are preserved for users on older software versions

## How to Create a New Version

### Step 1: Determine Version Number

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Is this a new document?**
   - Use `v1.0` for the first version of a new document

2. **Are you adding/removing chapters?**
   - Yes → Major version (e.g., `v1.0` → `v2.0`)
   - No → Continue to next question

3. **Are you significantly rewriting multiple chapters?**
   - Yes → Major version
   - No → Minor version (e.g., `v1.0` → `v1.1`)

### Step 2: Copy Existing Version Folder

**Using Command Line:**

```bash
# Copy most recent version to new version
cp -r docs/software-name/v1.0 docs/software-name/v1.1

# Windows PowerShell:
Copy-Item -Recurse docs/software-name/v1.0 docs/software-name/v1.1
```

**Using File Explorer:**

1. Navigate to `docs/software-name/`
2. Copy the most recent version folder (e.g., `v1.0`)
3. Paste and rename to new version (e.g., `v1.1`)

### Step 3: Update Content in New Version

1. Make your changes in the **new version folder** only
2. Leave the old version folder unchanged
3. Update relevant files (chapters, images, etc.)

**Example:**

```
docs/
└── lifesim/
    ├── v1.0/              ← Don't touch
    │   └── 03-usage.mdx   (original content)
    └── v1.1/              ← Edit here
        └── 03-usage.mdx   (updated content)
```

### Step 4: Update Images/Assets

If adding new images for the new version:

1. Create version-specific folder:

   ```
   static/
   └── figures/
       └── software-name/
           ├── v1.0/      ← Old version images
           └── v1.1/      ← New version images
   ```

2. Update image paths in MDX files:
   ```mdx
   <Figure
     src="/figures/software-name/v1.1/new-screenshot.png"
     ...
   />
   ```

### Step 5: Restart Development Server

After creating a new version folder, restart the development server to trigger automatic version detection:

```bash
# Stop the server (if running)
Ctrl + C

# Start the server
npm start
```

**What Happens Automatically:**

- Build scripts detect the new version folder
- Version metadata is generated in `static/versions/`
- Version selector dropdown is updated
- Default version is set

:::info
All necessary scripts run automatically during `npm start` or `npm run build`. You never need to run scripts manually.
:::

### Step 6: Verify New Version

1. **Start Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check Version Selector:**
   - Look for dropdown in top navigation
   - Verify new version appears in list
   - Click to switch between versions

3. **Test Content:**
   - Browse new version pages
   - Verify images load correctly
   - Check all links work
   - Test cross-references

### Step 7: Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add v1.1 documentation with updated usage guide"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## Version Selector for Users

The version selector appears in the top navigation bar, allowing users to switch between documentation versions.

**How It Works:**

- Automatically populated from version folders
- Shows all available versions for that documentation
- Preserves current page when switching (if page exists in both versions)
- Redirects to homepage if page doesn't exist in selected version

**Default Version:**

- Latest version is set as default for new visitors
- Last selected version remembered in browser

---

## Best Practices

### When to Version

**DO create a new version when:**

- Software has a new release you're documenting
- Making changes users need to be aware of
- Content changes significantly affect user workflows
- Adding substantial new information

**DON'T create a new version when:**

- Fixing typos or minor errors
- Adjusting formatting
- Making editorial improvements
- Updating links

### Naming Consistency

**Required Format:**

- Use lowercase `v` prefix: `v1.0`, `v2.1`
- Always include minor version: `v1.0` not `v1`
- Match software version when applicable

**Don't Use:**

- `version-1.0`, `1.0`, `V1.0`, `ver1.0`

### Version History Table

**Requirement:**

All documentation **must** include a version history table at the beginning of the document. This table tracks all versions and changes over time.

```mdx
import TableVersionHistory from '@site/src/components/TableVersionHistory';

<TableVersionHistory
  versionHistoryKey="lifesim-history"
  header={['Version', 'Date', 'Description']}
  data={[
    ['1.1', '2024-03-15', 'Updated usage guide with new import features'],
    ['1.0', '2024-01-10', 'Initial release'],
  ]}
/>
```

## Troubleshooting Versions

### New Version Not Appearing

**Solutions:**

1. Verify folder structure: `docs/software-name/vX.Y/`
2. Restart dev server: Stop (Ctrl+C) and `npm start`
3. Clear cache: `rm -rf .docusaurus` then `npm start`

### Version Selector Not Working

**Check:**

- Version metadata files exist in `static/versions/`
- Folder names follow format: `v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.
- Each version folder contains at least one `.mdx` file

**Fix:**

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart
npm start
```

### Wrong Default Version

**Solution:**

- Default version is typically the highest version number
- To change: Modify version detection script (advanced, contact site administrator)

## Summary

**Quick Reference:**

| Action                            | Version Change |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Fix typo                          | None           |
| Expand section with examples      | Minor (X.Y)    |
| Add new chapter                   | Major (X.0)    |
| Rewrite multiple chapters         | Major (X.0)    |
| Update for software patch release | Minor (X.Y)    |
| Update for software major release | Major (X.0)    |

**Remember:**

- Each version is a complete copy in its own folder
- All scripts run automatically during `npm start` or `npm run build`
- Old versions remain accessible to users
- Match software versions when documenting software releases
