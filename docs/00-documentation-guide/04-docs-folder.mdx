# The `docs/` Folder

The `docs/` folder contains all `.mdx` documentation files for the RMC Software Documentation project. It is organized by application type and document, with a consistent structure for all documentation sets.

## Subfolders

- **desktop-applications/**: Documentation for desktop applications (e.g., RMC-TotalRisk, RMC-RFA, LifeSim, etc.)
- **toolbox-technical-manuals/**: RMC toolbox technical manuals
- **web-applications/**: Documentation for web applications (e.g., LST, DST, RRFT, etc.)

## Document Layout and Naming Convention

Each document should follow a similar format and naming convention:  
`report##-document-title.mdx`

### Section 1 – Document Information

Contained within a collapsible sidebar titled **"Document Information"** (collapsed by default).

1. `00-document-info.mdx`

   - Always the first chapter
   - Uses the `DocumentMetadata` React component to provide document information

2. `00-version-history.mdx`
   - Always the second chapter
   - Uses the `TableVersionHistory` React component to provide a table of versions, descriptions of changes, and individuals who modified, reviewed, and approved the versions

### Section 2 – Main Report

Houses the main report chapters for the document, within a collapsible sidebar titled **"Main Report"** (expanded by default).  
Chapter filenames should begin with `01` and increase sequentially (`01`, `02`, `03`, etc.).

1. `01-preface.mdx` — The first main report chapter will always be titled "Preface"
2. `02-chapter-2.mdx`
3. `03-chapter-3.mdx`
4. ...

The file path for each report follows this standard:

- For desktop applications:  
  `docs/desktop-applications/{software-name}/{report-title}/{version-number}/{document-name}`

- For toolbox technical manuals:  
  `docs/toolbox-technical-manuals/{toolbox-suite}/{toolbox-name}/{version-number}/{document-name}`

- For web applications:  
  `docs/web-applications/{web-app-name}/{report-title}/{version-number}/{document-name}`

### Section 3 – Appendices

Houses appendices for the document, within a collapsible sidebar titled **"Appendices"** (collapsed by default).  
Appendix filenames should continue in sequential order after the main report chapters (e.g., if the final main report chapter is `05`, the first appendix chapter will be `06`).

## Best Practices

- Use clear, consistent naming for all `.mdx` files.
- Always start with `00-document-info.mdx` and `00-version-history.mdx`.
- Use numeric prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) for main chapters and appendices to ensure correct ordering in the sidebar.
- Place all images, figures, and supporting files in the appropriate subfolders under `static/`.
