# Docs Folder

The `docs/` folder contains all `.mdx` documentation files for the RMC Software Documentation project. It is organized by application type and document, with a
consistent structure for all documentation sets.

---

## Folder Structure Overview

The documentation is organized in a structured hierarchy to support scalability and clarity.

### 1. Root Documentation Folder

- **`docs/`** - The root folder for all documentation content.

### 2. Hub Subfolders

Each subfolder corresponds to a type of application, called a "hub":

- **`desktop-applications/`** – For desktop tools like `RMC-TotalRisk`, `RMC-RFA`, `LifeSim`, etc.

- **`toolbox-technical-manuals/`** – RMC Toolbox technical manuals

- **`web-applications/`** – For web tools like `LST`, `DST`, `RRFT`, etc.

### 3. Sub-Hub Subfolders

Each hub folder contains folders for individual software or tool suites, called "sub-hubs":

- **`rmc-totalrisk/`** – Documentation for RMC-TotalRisk
- **`internal-erosion-suite/`** – Documentation for the Internal Erosion Toolbox
- **`lst/`** – Documentation for the LST web application

### 4. Document-Specific Subfolders

Within each software folder, documents are grouped by title:

- **`users-guide/`**
- **`backward-erosion-piping-progression/`**

### 5. Version-Specific Subfolders

Each document includes version folders, such as:

- **`v1.0/`**
- **`v1.1/`**
- **`v2.0/`**

### 6. Chapter Files

Each version folder contains one `.mdx` file per chapter, named using a consistent convention (e.g., `01-preface.mdx`, `02-methodology.mdx`, etc.).

---

## Document Layout and Naming Convention

Every chapter within a document should follow the naming convention:

`##-document-title.mdx`

The numeric prefix (`##`) determines the order of the chapter in the sidebar and ensures proper navigation.

Documents are organized into **three main sections**:

1. Document Information
2. Main Report
3. Appendices

### 1. Document Information

This section appears in a collapsible sidebar titled **"Document Information"** (collapsed by default). It includes two required chapters:

#### `00-document-info.mdx`

- Always the **first chapter** in the document.
- Uses the `<DocumentMetadata />` React component.
- Provides metadata such as project title, authorship, document number, approval status, and publication date.

#### `00-version-history.mdx`

- Always the **second chapter**.
- Uses the `<TableVersionHistory />` component.
- Displays version numbers, change summaries, dates, and the names of individuals who authored, reviewed, and approved each version.

### 2. Main Report

This section appears in a collapsible sidebar titled **"Main Report"** (expanded by default).  
Each chapter begins with a two-digit prefix that increases sequentially.

#### Example Chapter Filenames

- `01-preface.mdx` (always the first chapter)
- `02-chapter-2.mdx`
- `03-chapter-3.mdx`
- `04-methodology.mdx`
- `05-results.mdx`

Chapters should follow a clear naming convention and reflect the actual content.

### 3. Appendices

This section appears in a collapsible sidebar titled **"Appendices"** (collapsed by default).  
Chapters continue the sequential numbering from the main report.

#### Example Appendix Filenames

- `06-appendix-acronyms.mdx`
- `07-appendix-analysis.mdx`
- `08-appendix-calculations.mdx`

Appendices may include supplementary data, calculations, or additional figures.

:::warning

**Important:** Always verify that the numeric prefixes in filenames match the desired sidebar order. Inconsistent numbering can lead to broken navigation and reader confusion.

## Best Practices

- Use clear, consistent naming for all `.mdx` files.
- Always start with `00-document-info.mdx` and `00-version-history.mdx`.
- Use numeric prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) for main chapters and appendices to ensure correct ordering in the sidebar.
- Place all images, figures, and supporting files in the appropriate subfolders under `static/`.
