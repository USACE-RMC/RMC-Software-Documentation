# The `static/` Folder

The `static/` folder contains all static files used by the RMC Software Documentation project. These files are served directly by Docusaurus and are accessible via URLs relative to the site root. The folder is organized into several subfolders to support bibliographies, counters, figures, fonts, images, and versioning.

## Subfolders and Contents

- **bibliographies/**  
  Contains JSON files used by the `Bibliography` React component to create reference lists for each report.

  - Each bibliography file should be named according to the applicable report ID.
  - References should be formatted using the IEEE style guide.

- **counters/**  
  Contains JSON files created by the `counters.js` script for each report.

  - Each report ID has its own counters JSON file.
  - These files store sequential numbering and metadata for figures, tables, equations, and citations.

- **figures/**  
  Repository of figure images used within the documentation.

  - The folder structure should mirror that of the `docs/` folder for consistency.
  - Example:
    ```
    static/figures/
      desktop-applications/
        rmc-totalrisk/
          users-guide/
            v1.0/
              figure1.png
              figure2.png
    ```
  - File names for figure images can be assigned as needed, but should be referenced by `Figure` components in `.mdx` files using an intuitive naming convention.

- **fonts/**  
  Contains downloaded font files for use with custom CSS.

- **img/**  
  Contains static images used within website pages (e.g., logos, icons, banners).

- **versions/**  
  Contains JSON files produced by the `versions.js` script for version management and Algolia search:
  - `algoliaCrawlerVersions.json`: Contains start URLs and discovery patterns for Algolia's documentation crawler.
  - `latestVersions.json`: Lists the latest version for each report in the `docs/` folder.
  - `versionList.json`: Lists all available versions for each report in the `docs/` folder.

## Best Practices

- Organize images and figures in subfolders that match the structure of your documentation for easy reference.
- Name bibliography and counter files according to the report ID to ensure correct linking with React components.
- Only place static assets (not code or documentation) in the `static/` folder.
