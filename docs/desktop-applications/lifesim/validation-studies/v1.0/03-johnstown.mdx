# Johnstown

South Fork Dam in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States.

## Overview

South Fork Dam, 15 miles upstream of Johnstown, PA, was originally constructed in 1852 for Portage Canal water supply. The dam breached in 1862. However, the reservoir elevation was 
not at full capacity, and downstream damage was minimal (McCullough, 1968  <Citation citationKey="McCullough1968"/>). By 1881, the dam had been repaired to maintain a permanent lake for recreation. 
The rebuilt dam did not have adequate spillway capacity. 

On Friday, May 31, 1889, overnight heavy rain led to flooding that exceeded record levels 
by 12:00 PM. Between 2:45 PM and 3:00 PM, the dam breached due to overtopping, releasing the entire reservoir in a short amount of time (HDR, 2022 <Citation citationKey="HDR2022"/>). 
The breach 
inundation arrived at Johnstown about an hour later. The flooding was catastrophic, resulting in the destruction of most Johnstown structures and the loss of 
an estimated 2,209 lives (McCullough, 1968  <Citation citationKey="McCullough1968"/>).

## Data

The following provides a short description of the data sources used for validation. 

Data were collected for both hydraulic and consequence modeling efforts from many sources including books, articles, and maps archived at the Library of Congress.

### Hydraulics

HDR, Inc. (HDR) was tasked with developing the 1889 South Fork Dam breach inundation model within the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis 
System (HEC-RAS). A 2-dimensional (2D) unsteady hydraulic model of the South Fork Dam and subsequent Viaduct Bridge breaches were developed based on the best available 
topography data, collected historic data, and previous studies. Breach parameters were developed based on analysis of photos, drawings, and previous studies 
(Kaktins et al., 2013 <Citation citationKey="Kaktins2013"/>, Coleman et al., 2016 <Citation citationKey="Coleman2016"/>). The model was used to simulate the South Fork Dam breach, 
the subsequent Viaduct breach, and the flood inundation 
along Conemaugh River from South Fork Dam to five miles downstream of Johnstown Stone Bridge. The 2D modeling results were then provided as input for consequence 
analysis using LifeSim. 

For a detailed account of HDR’s hydraulic data collection effort, see the *South Fork Dam Failure Case Study* inundation modeling report (HDR, 2022
<Citation citationKey="HDR2022"/>).

### Structure Inventory

The primary source for the structure inventory was a set of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from 1886 <Citation citationKey="SanbornJohnstown1886"/>. The 1886 Sanborn map 
consists of an index page and 13 detailed grid maps. These were georeferenced in Esri ArcGIS 
Pro based on the street intersections. The detailed maps contain building footprints, number of stories, and construction type (brick, stone, or wood). They 
also contain a building use description (dwelling, tenement, or business type/name). In areas where detailed maps were not available, structure points were 
created based on counts from the index map and an estimated layout assuming stables are in the middle alley. An 1895 map <Citation citationKey="SanbornSouthFork1895"/> with a larger 
footprint was also used 
as a resource for areas not covered by the 1886 map, particularly for South Fork and the northwest area of Cambria. The primary source for population was an
1889 canvas for the Johnstown directory. All occupants were assumed to be under the age of 65 in the structure 
inventory.

The final inventory was comprised of 2,261 structures with total mean population-at-risk (PAR) in the inundation area around 10,800. 

### Road Network

Traffic evacuations were not simulated. Therefore, a road network was not configured.

### Destinations

Traffic evacuations were not simulated. Therefore, destinations were not configured.

### Emergency Planning Zones

As most of the PAR had no warning of the dam breach prior to when breach flow arrived, zero **Warning Issuance Delay** time and immediate **First Alert** 
diffusion were inputted for the LifeSim model’s **Emergency Planning Zone**. 

The best estimate scenario parameters were chosen to reflect as best as possible what happened in the historical event. Since there was no specific 
warning that was distributed to the Johnstown area, the primary driver of life loss from a LifeSim parameter standpoint was the amount of mobilization 
that occurred prior to the breach flood arrival. Mobilization also has the greatest uncertainty, as sources are unspecific as to how many people 
evacuated due to pre-breach flooding (hundreds of families or hundreds of people). Given this uncertainty, the mobilization (**Protective Action Initiation**) 
was set to a uniform distribution between 20% and 50%.

### Alternative

To understand how the LifeSim parameters influence the results, multiple sensitivity simulations were initially run. The parameters tested were the 
mobilization rates, the warning times, and the structure stability curves. 

To facilitate reaching the mobilization caps within each iteration, warning was set at the beginning of the simulation for the area flooded prior to the 
breach, and the area flooded only in the event of breach had a warning set at +1 hour relative to breach, which roughly represents the initial arrival of 
the breach flooding at Johnstown.

The best estimate structure stability selected was the **Wood Buoyant - Heavy** curve, with a **Triangular** uncertainty distribution.

## Modeling Conclusion

    title:[
      <>
      The South Fork Dam failure that caused the devasting flooding of Johnstown, PA in 1889 was the deadliest dam failure in the history of the United States. 
      This validation study has shown that HEC-RAS and LifeSim can produce a life loss estimate very similar to what happened in 1889.

## Model Version

The original LifeSim model was developed in 2022 using LifeSim version 2.0. The public model was updated in 2025 to LifeSim version 2.1.5 and produced 
negligible changes from the original documented results.
