# Kelly Barnes

Kelly Barnes Dam in Toccoa Falls, Georgia, United States.

## Overview

Kelly Barnes Dam – located above the Toccoa Falls Bible College near Toccoa, Georgia – failed in the early morning hours of November 6, 1977. The flood 
wave plummeted over the 186-foot tall Toccoa Falls and crashed through the Toccoa Falls College community. The resulting flood caused 39 fatalities and inundated 
a majority of the college campus (<FigReference figKey="dorm-flooded"/>), nearby residential homes, and a downstream trailer park.

The Kelly Barnes Dam breach was chosen for the LifeSim validation effort because of the robust quantity of details diligently recorded by engineers 
and historians on the failure. In the community impacted, data is available to locate nearly every structure and fatality in the wake of the flood. Also available are 
written and detailed firsthand accounts of the flood, which allow for uniquely detailed comparisons between the model and historical accounts that are impossible 
in most cases due to lack of data.

## Data

The following provides a short description of the data sources used for validation. 

### Hydraulics

A single hydraulic event was created for this analysis based on *Report of Failure of Kelly Barnes Dam, Toccoa, GA* published by the Federal Investigative Board 
in 1977 <Citation citationKey="FIB1977"/> and the USGS Hydrologic Investigations Atlas HA-613 <Citation citationKey="Sanders1979"/>.

Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) version 5.0.7 was used to develop a 2-dimensional (2D) hydraulic model of the study area. The hydraulic model begins at Barnes Lake and ends at Highway 17. 
Water is routed from both the primary and secondary spillways until failure.

The terrain used for this model originates from a 3m resolution DEM obtained from the USDA Data Gateway as part of the National Elevation Dataset (NED). 
A new spillway profile was cut into the terrain using tools available in HEC-RAS and elevations provided in HA-613.

### Structure Inventory

Structures included in the structure inventory were located and defined based on the building footprint maps included as part of the USGS HA-613 <Citation citationKey="Sanders1979"/> 
and *Dam Break in 
Georgia: Sadness and Joy at Toccoa Falls* <Citation citationKey="Foster1978"/>. More information was found from Google Earth aerial imagery, as well as 
photographs and personal testimony provided by the Toccoa Falls College.  

The population data for the structure inventory was created using only historical accounts and documents which linked population to structures at the time 
of the flood. This data is based primarily on *Dam Break in Georgia: Sadness and Joy at Toccoa Falls* <Citation citationKey="Foster1978"/>. This publication includes details and personal stories 
from the night of the flood and accounts for the locations and nature of all 39 fatalities. 

### Road Network and Destinations

The road network was imported from Open Street Map <Citation citationKey="OSM"/> and minor modifications were made to match historical images.

Destinations were chosen at four locations to allow evacuees the most direct route to high ground. 

The road network and destinations, however, have very little impact on model results due to the very short warning time. In very few iterations are there 
any evacuations on the road network. The road network is used more heavily for simulations created for validation of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Modeling, Mapping, and Consequence (MMC) Production Center standard operating procedure.

### Emergency Planning Zones

Toccoa Falls was modeled under a single **Emergency Planning Zone** (EPZ). **First Alert** and **Protective Action Initiation** were set to unknown, as both of these 
parameters are dependent on the readiness of the community – of which there is very little data to inform. 

A sensitivity analysis was done on this parameter by creating two alternative EPZs using the default slow and fast parameters. Due to the short warning 
time, the effect of these parameters is negligible. Among the sensitivity analysis alternatives, mean life loss varies between 48.69 and 48.90.

### Alternative

No formal warning was issued during the Kelly Barnes Dam breach because the hazard was not identified until the flood wave reached town. For this reason, 
the **Imminent Hazard ID Time** is set to 0.2 hours after the breach, which is the amount of time post-breach it takes the flood wave to reach the upstream end of 
town and marks the location where the danger can first be seen from town. 

**Hazard Communication Delay** and **Warning Issuance Delay** do not accurately represent the warning scenario because evacuation is driven by individuals seeing 
the threat, choosing to evacuate, or choosing to warn neighbors. In this scenario, there is no communicating the threat to an emergency management entity 
or issuing a warning; therefore, these parameters are set to zero.

## Modeling Conclusion

Due to the heavy documentation available (Foster & Mills, 1978 <Citation citationKey="Foster1978"/>), model disagreements from the historical accounts are able to be analyzed.

The following is a compilation of structures in the model validation simulation for which the historical recorded life loss does not fall within the bounds of the 25th 
to the 75th percentile of the model results – they do, however, fall within the minimum and maximum model iterations.

### Forrest Hall

**Historical Account**

Jerry Britton (23), Cory Hanna (30), and Richard Swires (21) drowned in the basement of the 2-4 story brick dormitory (Capacity 147). 124 students were registered, 
but an estimated 75 were in the building on the night of the dam breach. Four students escaped from the basement seconds before it was flooded to the 
ceiling. There were eight rooms in the basement with stairwells at each end of the hall.

**Model Discussion**

LifeSim does not consider the added risk of having bedrooms in the basement. There is added difficulty in evacuating vertically due to an additional story to climb, 
particularly when flooding comes as a surprise.  

### Guard Shack

**Historical Account**

The guard shack is normally occupied by two guards. Both guards were in LeTournou Hall when the flood came through due to awareness of the changing water levels.
No formal warning was sent out, but the shack was close enough to the stream that when minor flooding began (before the dam breached), it was enough to convince them to evacuate to higher ground. 

**Model Discussion**

The guards' evacuation was not driven by a dam breach hazard, but by the expected “typical” flood hazard. Modifying the model to include an individual EPZ would 
better model this early warning. 

### Eby House

**Historical Account**

Dave Eby (Dean of Men) and five other occupants were washed out of the house but swam/crawled back in after spending time on the roof. 
Barbara Kim (mother) and two others clung to the wall divider inside the house, with max depth inside about neck-deep. The house had walls destroyed but stayed mostly intact and floated into an 
eddy. 

All survived. 

**Model Discussion**

The occupants all survived by floating in the structure or on furniture, whereas modeled results estimates this survival to be unlikely.

### Nicholson Trailer

**Historical Account**

Occupants were Jerry (~29), Pat (~29), Michael (7), Tim (7) with location assumed. The individuals saw several trailers and buses floating away. Their trailer then floated
off its foundation. Another trailer tore a hole in the side, and they all floated out on a foam mattress. All were pulled from the water near a farm by Archie Smith. 

**Model Discussion**

The account given above of the evacuation method and circumstances are extreme, and it is reasonable to believe that the modeled life loss is appropriate. 
The Nicholson family were able to survive despite the odds being against them. 

### Smith Trailer

**Historical Account**

Archie, unnamed wife, and child Kendra (10) managed to flee their trailer on foot. They were caught by the flood wave as they ran toward upper Trailerville. 
Archie grabbed the Pinney car and floated to safety just before it sank. Kendra was pulled and rescued from the flood.

**Model Discussion**

The Smith family survived by fleeing on foot or floating along. Fleeing on foot was not possible in the LifeSim model due to the lack of a formal warning being issued.

### Kemp Trailer

**Historical Account**

Thurman (~32), Dixie (~30), Chris (7), Morgan (9), and Ruby (>65) assumed to be occupants of the Kemp trailer. It was the first trailer to float. 
The floor collapsed. Thurman saved Morgan. Dixie could not hold onto Chris, who drowned. Ruby floated to safety on furniture. 

**Model Discussion**

Similar to the Eby House, occupants survived by floating in the structure or on furniture, whereas modeled results estimates this survival to be unlikely.

## Model Version

The original LifeSim model was developed in 2019 using LifeSim version 2.0. The public model was updated in 2025 to LifeSim version 2.1.5 and produced 
negligible changes from the original documented results.
