# Katrina - NOLA East Bowl

New Orleans Levee System during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans (East Bowl), Louisiana, United States.

The public LifeSim model is available for download <a href="https://www.rmc.usace.army.mil/Software/LifeSim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">*here*</a>.

## Overview

Hurricane Katrina (Katrina) formed as a tropical depression over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005. Katrina intensified after making landfall in southern Florida and became a 
Category 5 with peak winds of 175 mph; it was one of the most devastating natural disasters in United States history (NWS 2005).

Katrina had weakened to a Category 3 when it made landfall in New Orleans, Louisiana (NOLA) the morning of August 29, 2005. Life loss and property damage were exacerbated in NOLA due to 
the levee failures across the city. Over 50 locations of the levees and floodwalls in NOLA experienced failure during this catastrophic event (Pruitt 2020). Approximately 80 percent of 
the city was flooded â€“ causing over 1,400 fatalities and hundreds of thousands displaced (NYT 2015).

This validation data set focuses on the New Orleans East Bowl (highlighted red in <FigReference figKey="katrina-nola-map"/> below). According to <FigReference figKey="katrina-nola-map"/>, 
of the 27,986 housing units in New Orleans East, 79 percent 
was flooded, and 9.4 percent was over seven feet of inundation. New Orleans East is comprised of sub-divisions, large business and manufacturing areas, and a wildlife refuge. It had an 
estimated population of 96,400 people and average income of $41,997 in August 2005 (NYT 2015).

## Data

The following provides a short description of the data sources used for validation.

### Hydraulics

xx

### Structure Inventory

xx

### Road Network

Traffic and evacuations were not simulated. Therefore, a road network was not configured.

### Destinations

Traffic and evacuations were not simulated. Therefore, destinations were not configured.

### Emergency Planning Zones

Separate LifeSim validation studies and analyses were created for Katrina + NOLA, including a St. Bernard Bowl study, Main Bowl study, and this East Bowl study. Therefore, the 
Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) is set to one area that covers the entirety of New Orleans East. 

Zero Warning Issuance Delay was implemented in the model due to the long warning time. Elicited First Alert and Protective Action Initiation (PAI) curves were created for New Orleans East.

### Alternative

The mayor of NOLA issued the official evacuation order of NOLA at 9:25am on August 28, 2005 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9upJ1vRCgoo), approximately one day before landfall. The 
Imminent Hazard Identification is set to -24 hours with zero Hazard Communication Delay due to the long warning time.
