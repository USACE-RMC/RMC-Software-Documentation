## Overview

On January 25, 2019, the Feij√£o Dam B-1 Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) at Minas C√≥rrego do Feij√£o mine in Brumadinho, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil failed 
catastrophically. A devastating downstream mudflow inflicted extreme to complete damage to many structures, vehicles (<FigReference figKey="brumadinho-mud"/>), 
and transportation infrastructure, and 270 fatalities were caused. The Feij√£o Dam B-1 event provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate how LifeSim 
can be used to analyze a historic TSF failure event, to provide insights into how life loss can be estimated for these types of events, and to show how this 
approach could be used to inform consequences estimation and risk assessments for existing, or proposed, tailings storage facilities.

## Data

The complete Brumadinho validation study analysis is documented in the Morrill-Winter & Johnstone 2025 abstract <Citation citationKey="MorrillWinter2025"/>.

The following provides a short description of the data sources used for validation. 

Examples of key sources include the Robertson et al. (2019) expert panel report <Citation citationKey="Robertson2019"/>, a book by the journalist Arbex (2022) 
<Citation citationKey="Arbex2022"/>, post-disaster investigations 
and support by Brazil‚Äôs Federal and State of Minas Gerais legislatures, ministries and agencies (Assembleia Ligislativa do Minas Gerais, 2019 
<Citation citationKey="AssembleiaMinas2019"/>); Government 
of Brazil, 2019a <Citation citationKey="BrazilGov2019a"/>, 2019b <Citation citationKey="BrazilGov2019b"/>), reports from media outlets (e.g., Globo [2019] 
<Citation citationKey="Globo2019"/>), 
journal papers by Lumbroso et al. (2021) <Citation citationKey="Lumbroso2021"/> who developed a post-failure model 
of the event using the HRW Life Safety Model and by Passos and de Freitas (2021) <Citation citationKey="Passos2021"/> who describe the immediate post-failure response and longer-term work by 
the Bombeiros of Minas Gerais to locate and recover the remains of the victims, and work by the Instituto Medico Legal in Belo Horizonte to organize, 
identify and return these remains (da Rocha, Silva, & da Silva, 2022 <Citation citationKey="Rocha2022"/>; Quierati, 2019 <Citation citationKey="Quierati2019"/>) and to determine causes 
of death (Araujo et al., 2022 <Citation citationKey="Araujo2022"/>).

### Hydraulics

Four breach outflow and runout models of the event were identified by this study: a pre-failure model developed by Walm Engineering to 
inform Emergency Action Plan (EAP) development (Vale & Walm Engenharia, 2018a <Citation citationKey="ValeWalm2018a"/>, 2018b <Citation citationKey="ValeWalm2018b"/>), post-failure models 
developed by Lumbroso et al. (2021) <Citation citationKey="Lumbroso2021"/> and by Gibson et al. (2022) <Citation citationKey="Gibson2022"/>, and 
more recent work by Adria et al. (2023) <Citation citationKey="Adria2023"/> to investigate the properties and arrival times of the runout downstream to the Rio Paraopeba. This study used the 
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model developed by Gibson et al. (2022) <Citation citationKey="Gibson2022"/> as the 100% (i.e., ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù) event. 

### Structure Inventory

Web-based sources such as Google, Esri, and OpenStreetMap <Citation citationKey="OSM"/> were used to provide before and after base mapping and imagery of the full 
extent of the impact zone and surrounding region. 

Structures and outdoor areas located in and around the tailings runout zone were compiled starting with a baseline dataset from Lumbroso et al. (2021) <Citation citationKey="Lumbroso2021"/>. 
More structures, outdoor areas, and details were then added using pre-failure Google and Esri satellite imagery, and OpenStreetMap basemap sources. Multiple structure 
datasets were created to model variations in population sizes and distribution, number of stories, stability criteria and structure location. 

### Road Network

Development of the road and trail network started with a downloaded copy of the OpenStreetMap dataset <Citation citationKey="OSM"/>. Additional GIS editing effort was required to 
ensure that the network model had correct nodal connections at street intersections. 

### Destinations

A related GIS points layer was created to define the set of target evacuation destinations outside of the impact zone. This was based on Vale‚Äôs 
emergency action plan design (PAEBM) (Vale & Walm Engenharia, 2018a <Citation citationKey="ValeWalm2018a"/>, 2018b <Citation citationKey="ValeWalm2018b"/>).

### Emergency Planning Zones

A GIS polygon layer was created to define the **Emergency Planning Zones** (EPZs) that are used to vary the community warning and evacuation times. This allowed the LifeSim 
modelers to set up different ranges of warning times. Seven **EPZ** zones were created, each with validated **Warning Issuance Delay**, **First Alert**, and 
**Protective Action Initiation** curves applicable per zone.

### Alternative

A total of 59 alternatives were created and grouped into twelve simulations that focused on key goals of the study for the sensitivity runs.

For the event validation alternative, to simulate the lack of an official warning, the **Imminent Hazard ID Time** was set to 1 hour after the breach. 
Zero **Hazard Communication Delay** is assumed.

## Modeling Conclusion

The Feij√£o Dam B-1 Tailings Dam Failure case study successfully demonstrated how LifeSim can be used
to develop a useful model of this historic event. The majority of the event validity life loss estimates
encompass the observed consequences. 

It was possible to characterize the population-at-risk (PAR) for a range of location types (e.g., residential, industrial,
agricultural), for variations by time of day, ranges of TSF breach outflow scenarios, and to explore how
variations in EAPs and community preparedness can influence life loss outcomes. 

While the study confirmed the strengths of the LifeSim simulator and methodology, and no fundamental gaps
were found, modifications and adjustments to existing methods could increase the value of the simulator
for modelling TSF failure and runout events. This includes:

- Develop a better understanding of how tailings flows affect buildings, vehicles, and people via
mechanisms such as adhesion, fouling, and deposition. Examples include more building damage, loss
of transport (vehicles cannot move, vehicles stall), impacts on pedestrians, and compromised firstresponder rescues 
(deposited tailings become barriers to emergency vehicles).

- Investigate how object (buildings, vehicles) stability calibrations can be adjusted to account for the
physical properties of tailings flows, and whether there is a need to adjust the mortality rate curves.

- Add the ‚ÄúFire Drill‚Äù Protective Action Initiation response pattern to represent well-trained
industrial PAR.

- Since the Feij√£o Dam B-1 failure is only one of four types of TDBA event identified by the CDA‚Äôs
2021 Bulletin, the LifeSim methodology (and possibly the simulator) may need to be extended to also
support modeling TSF failure events that have both a supernatant pond and liquefiable tailings.

- Importance to study other TSF incidents and failures with different characteristics such as: larger communities,
larger PAR, the potential for earlier detection and warning, medium- to lower-intensity tailings flows,
longer downstream runout distances, lower life loss rates, and successful evacuations. 

## Model Version

The original LifeSim model was developed in 2022 using LifeSim version 2.0. The public model was updated in 2025 to LifeSim version 2.1.5 and 
produced zero observed changes from the original documented results.
