# Installing LifeSim

This chapter describes the recommended computer system requirements for installing and running LifeSim. The software includes a graphical user interface (GUI), 
designed to increase the usability and efficiency of the software. The LifeSim GUI provides for file management, data entry and editing, and viewing output results. 

## Requirements

- 1GB RAM (random access memory); recommended 4GB RAM 
- Quad-Core CPU with 2.7 GHz (or faster) clock speed.

## Installation

LifeSim is available as a portable package (.zip) which can be downloaded here (https://github.com/USACE-RMC/LifeSim/releases/). Installing a portable package does not require administrative rights. Simply extract all 
contents of the portable package to the desired computer location. <FigReference figKey="package-contents" /> shows an example of the package contents after extraction. Double-click the executable LifeSim.exe to get started. For easy access to the program, 
create a desktop shortcut and pin the program to the Windows task bar.
