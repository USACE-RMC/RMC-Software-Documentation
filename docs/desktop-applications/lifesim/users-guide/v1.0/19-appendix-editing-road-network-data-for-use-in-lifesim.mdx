# Appendix C - Editing Road Network Data for use in LifeSim

The road network is an important part of the LifeSim computations when simulating the evacuation process. A road network with missing connectivity or
incorrect directions on one-way roads can lead to erroneous results. This appendix provides some methods for editing the road network dataset to
provide a reliable foundation for traffic simulation. This appendix makes use of the editing functionality in the map window of the LifeSim main
window (<FigReference figKey="figure-314" />). The map window functionality and a full list of the tools available can be found in [Appendix
B](#appendix-b-map-preferences.) The road network used in the following examples was obtained from OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/). This appendix focuses on two
aspects of road network improvement:

## Overview

The road network connectivity defines how vehicles can traverse from one road segment to the next road segment in LifeSim. Roads are considered
connected if the individual road segments share an end point.

If two roads do not share an end point then a vehicle cannot move between the two roads. Conversely, if two roads share an end point a vehicle can
move between the roads even if one is a bridge and the other is the road going underneath. The first step is to check for disconnect between road
segments (see [Disconnect Invalid Road Segment
Connections](./19-appendix-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim.mdx#disconnect-invalid-road-segment-connections) and [Roads That Should Be
Connected](./19-appendix-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim.mdx#roads-that-should-be-connected)). Another step to verify the direction on
one-way streets (refer to [Verify One-Way Street
Direction](./19-appendix-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim.mdx#verify-one-way-street-direction)).

### Disconnect Invalid Road Segment Connections

Invalid road segment connections can occur several ways. For example, it is common for overpasses or underpasses to have roads connected at the
overpass intersection. In LifeSim, this connection would imply that vehicles can jump from an overpass down onto a highway as if it were a standard
intersection.

For example, in <FigReference figKey="figure-312" />, in an off-ramp that goes underneath a highway is displayed. The road segment that goes
underneath the highway shares an endpoint with the highway. The invalid road segment connection would allow vehicles to immediately jump from the
highway to the underpass rather than take the off ramp, which would affect simulation results (i.e., destination arrival times, evacuation times,
evacuation outflow).

### Roads That Should Be Connected

Road segments that represent a continuous road can sometimes lack a common endpoint (<FigReference figKey="figure-323" />). When this happens,
vehicles in LifeSim cannot move from one segment to the next when in reality the vehicles clearly should be able move freely.

## Verify One-Way Street Direction

LifeSim's traffic simulation engine allows road segments to either be one-way or two-way road segments. If a road is considered one-way, then vehicles
 can only travel in one direction along the road segment. The direction is defined from the first point in the road segment to the last point in the
road segment and can be defined by enabling arrows to be drawn at the end of one-way roads through the road network map layer properties. For details
on how to use the map layer properties refer to [Map Layers Properties](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#map-layers-properties). Sometimes a road
segment that is defined as one-way will be pointing in the wrong direction. This would mean that vehicles would have to find a way around the
incorrectly oriented one-way segment. The following example (<FigReference figKey="figure-326" />) shows a case where a one-way highway segment is
pointing in the wrong direction and needs to be fixed.
