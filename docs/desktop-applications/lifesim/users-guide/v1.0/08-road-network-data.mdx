# Road Network Data

If traffic is being simulated (set from the Emergency Planning Zone Editor, see [EPZ Editor](#emergency-planning-zone-epz-editor)), road network data
and destination data (see [Destination Data](./09-destination-data.mdx#destination-data)) are required in a LifeSim study to represent possible
evacuation routes that people can take during an evacuation. The road network features can be categorized into multiple road types with attributes
defining their census feature classification codes (CFCC), flow direction, and vertical offset ([Appendix
C](./19-appendix-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim.mdx#appendix-c-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim)).

- The CFCC classification is a three-character system that is used to define feature data. The first character A denotes roads, the second character
is an integer that denotes road type (e.g., Primary Highway), and the third character further classifies within the road type (e.g., underpass). The
CFCC codes are used in LifeSim to define attributes about the road that affect transportation (e.g., free flow speed). Further information on CFCC
classification is available in [Appendix
C](./19-appendix-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim.mdx#appendix-c-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim).

- Roads can be defined as one-way directional in LifeSim. If roads are defined in this way, care must be taken to make sure that the direction and
links are set up correctly.

- The vertical offset attribute is designed for roads that are elevated above the ground such as a bridge that would have water running under the road
 instead of on the road.

[Appendix C](./19-appendix-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim.mdx#editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim) is designed to help users
prepare and edit road networks for use in LifeSim. The LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 6, describes the computational input
parameters required for the traffic simulation model used to determine the speed of vehicles at each time step. There are two ways to add road network
 data to an LifeSim study and only one format is supported (polygon shapefiles) to be utilized in LifeSim simulations.

## Road Classification Data

In LifeSim, roads are classified using census feature classification codes (CFCC). Users can view and edit the default CFCC codes; however, care
should be taken as the default road parameters have a significant impact on the traffic simulation model. To view and/or edit the default CFCC road
attributes:

1. From the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Road Networks</strong>
folder, right-click on <strong>Road Classification Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-126" />), and click <strong>Edit Road Classification
Data</strong> from the shortcut menu. The <strong>Road Classification Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-127" />) opens.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-127"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure127.png"
  alt="Road Classification Editor"
  caption="Road Classification Editor"
/>

1. A plot of the speed-density function is displayed at the top of the Road Classification Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-127" />). Review
[Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting
 tools (located on the right side of the plot window) and for customizing plots.

1. The editable road classification table below the plot window lists the default CFCC data. The road classification table lists the number of lanes,
free flow speed, jam density, break point density, stop and go speed, and Greenshields power term.

1. Users set the display units for the plot window and road classification table to either <strong>US Customary</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-127" />) or <strong>System International (SI)</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-128" />) using the slider bar
 at the bottom of the editor.

An existing CFCC road classification code can be edited, or new road classification codes can be defined following the remaining instructions in this
section.

1. To add a new road classification code, right-click a cell to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-127" />), from the shortcut menu
 click, <strong>Add Row(s)</strong>. By default, one row is added to the bottom of the road classification table (<FigReference figKey="figure-128" />
).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-128"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure128.png"
  alt="Example Road Classification Editor – Row Added for New Road Classification"
  caption="Example Road Classification Editor – Row Added for New Road Classification"
/>

1. For the new row, double-click the <strong>CFCC</strong> column and enter the road classification code. Double-click to enter the description of the
 new road in the <strong>Description</strong> column. Continue to enter the following road classification parameters in the new row:

  - <strong># Lanes</strong> – total number of lanes going in the same direction,

  - <strong>Free Flow Speed</strong> – this is the speed of vehicles on the road with no impediments,

  - <strong>Jam Density</strong> – this is the density of vehicles per mile required to create traffic jam conditions,

  - <strong>Break Point Density</strong> – this is the density of vehicles on the road required to start impacting the overall speed,

  - <strong>Stop and Go Speed</strong> – is the speed that vehicles travel when under stop and go conditions, and

  - <strong>Greenshields Power Term</strong> – this parameter is used to help define the relationship between speed and density of vehicles on the
road network.

1. Errors in the road classification table are highlighted in red (<FigReference figKey="figure-128" />) and a tooltip displays a message describing
the error. Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) to sort the table in ascending or descending
order, or clear the table sorting.

1. To edit an existing CFCC code, select the row for the desired code to view the speed-density function in the plot window (e.g.,
<em><strong>A48</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-127" />). Double-click the desired cell to edit the information for the selected CFCC
code.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Road Classification Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-127" />) closes and saves all edits to
road classification data.

## Create Road Network Datasets

Road network datasets can be created by importing information from a polyline shapefile that represents a road network. Another way to import a road
network dataset is using a bounding polygon shapefile to generate a road network using all available data within the bounding polygon from the
OpenStreetMap database ([Appendix
C](./19-appendix-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim.mdx#appendix-c-editing-road-network-data-for-use-in-lifesim)).

### Import from a Shapefile

To create a road network dataset from a polygon shapefile:

1. From the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to
<strong>Road Network Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), click <strong>Import From Shapefile</strong>. Another way is from the
<strong>Study Tree</strong>, right-click on <strong>Road Networks</strong>, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-130" />), click
<strong>Import Road Network From Shapefile</strong>.

1. Either way, the <strong>Import Road Network</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-131" />) will open.

<Figure

  alt="LifeSim Main Window – Study Menu – Road Network Data Sub-menu"
  caption="LifeSim Main Window – Study Menu – Road Network Data Sub-menu"
/>

<Figure
  figKey="figure-130"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure130.png"
  alt="LifeSim Study Tree – Road Networks – Shortcut Menu"

<Figure
  figKey="figure-131"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure131.png"
  alt="Import Road Network Dialog Box"
  caption="Import Road Network Dialog Box"
/>

1. Enter a name for the road network dataset in the <strong>Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-131" />).

1. To select the shapefile that contains information about the road network, to the right of the <strong>Road Network Shapefile</strong> dropdown menu
 (<FigReference figKey="figure-131" />), click . An <strong>Open</strong> browser window (<FigReference figKey="figure-132" />) opens; navigate to
the directory where the road network polyline shapefile is located. Select the correct polyline shapefile (e.g., <em>&#42;.shp</em>), click
<strong>Open</strong>; the <strong>Open</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-132" />) closes and the user is returned to the <strong>Import
 Road Network</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-133" />). The location and name of the selected polyline shapefile displays in the
<strong>Road Network Shapefile</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-133" />). Alternatively, if the desired shapefile has already been imported
 as a map layer into the LifeSim study, then from the <strong>Road Network Shapefile</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-131" />),
select the desired map layer.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-132"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure132.png"
  alt="Open Browser Window"
  caption="Open Browser Window"
/>

1. From the <strong>CFCC Name Field</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-133" />), select the appropriate attribute field in the
selected shapefile that lists the CFCC codes (e.g., <em><strong>CFCC</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-133" />). The CFCC field is used
to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a road.

1. If this information is not known (CFCC is not available from the CFCC Name Field list), then the user could access the shapefile attribute table
(see [Map Layer Attributes Dialog Box](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#map-layer-attributes-dialog-box)) for details on accessing the attribute
table) to determine which column header contains the CFCC road identifications (e.g., A73, A15, A63, etc.). Review [Road Classification
Data](./08-road-network-data.mdx#road-classification-data) for more information regarding the default CFCC codes in LifeSim.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-133"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure133.png"
  alt="Example – Completed Import Road Network Dialog Box"
  caption="Example – Completed Import Road Network Dialog Box"
/>

1. If the road network shapefile contains data classifying one-way streets and the attribute identification (e.g., true or false; yes or no; 0 or 1),
then the user can set the information for one-way streets (optional). For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-133" />, the
<strong>One-Way Field</strong> attribute is <em><strong>oneway</strong></em>, and the one-way field <strong>Identifier</strong> is
<em><strong>yes</strong></em>.

1. Another optional field which depends on the road networks shapefile attributes is the <strong>Vertical Offset</strong> dropdown menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-133" />), which sets the vertical offset.

1. Set the units for the road network to either <strong>US Customary</strong> or <strong>System International (SI)</strong> by using the slider bar
(e.g., <em><strong>US Customary</strong></em> is selected in <FigReference figKey="figure-133" />).

1. Once all of the information has been entered click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Import Road Network</strong> dialog will close (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-133" />). From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), from the <strong>Study
Tree</strong>, under the <strong>Road Networks </strong>folder, the name of the road network dataset is displayed.

### Import from OpenStreetMap

OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world (Appendix C). It is supported by a large community of dedicated
members to provide global geographic information system (GIS) data. LifeSim can take the road network information stored within the OpenStreetMap
database to create a road network for use in the software. To create a road network dataset from a bounding polygon shapefile:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Road Networks</strong>, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-130" />), click <strong>Import Road Network From
OpenStreeetMap</strong>. Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Road Network
Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), click <strong>Import From OpenStreetMap</strong>.

1. Either way, the <strong>Import Road Network From OpenStreetMap</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />) opens. Enter the name of
 the road network dataset in the <strong>Road Network Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-134"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure134.png"
  alt="Import Road Network From OpenStreetMap Dialog Box"
  caption="Import Road Network From OpenStreetMap Dialog Box"
/>

1. If the bounding polygon shapefile has been imported as a map layer, then select the map layer from the <strong>Bounding Polygon Shapefile</strong>
dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />). Otherwise, click the  button (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />). An <strong>Open</strong>
browser window (<FigReference figKey="figure-132" />) opens, navigate to the directory where the bounding polygon shapefile is located. Select the
correct polygon shapefile (e.g., <em>&#42;.shp</em>), click <strong>Open</strong>, the <strong>Open</strong> browser will close (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-132" />).

1. The selected shapefile displays in the <strong>Bounding Polygon Shapefile</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />). Enter the
 <strong>Bounding Polygon Buffer</strong> distance (positive value) if the default value, <em><strong>0</strong></em>, is not desired. Note, the units
 displayed in the <strong>Import Road Network From OpenStreetMAP</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />) is relative to the
horizontal unit of the underlying projection (typically feet). The buffer zone adds a consistent distance around the perimeter of the polygon area.

1. Enter the <strong>Maximum Road Length</strong> if the default value, <em><strong>3000</strong></em>, is not desired. Note, the units displayed in
the <strong>Import Road Network From OpenStreetMAP</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />) is relative to the horizontal unit of
the underlying projection (typically feet).

1. The OSM Highway and CFCC table (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />), allows users to select roads, classified by CFCC codes, to import. Import
the desired road(s) by checking the  checkboxes for the road(s); alternatively, uncheck the  checkboxes to prevent specific road(s) from importing.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and the <strong>Import Road Network From OpenStreetMap</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-134" />)
closes and a <strong>Progress Window</strong> opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-135" />). The <strong>Progress Window</strong> displays the import
process where LifeSim contacts the OpenStreetMap Data Server and retrieves data based on the selected bounding polygon shapefile and import conditions
 (buffer distance, max road length, CFCC selected roads).

1. Once the import is completed the <strong>Progress</strong> <strong>Window</strong> closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-135" />). From the LifeSim
 main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, under the <strong>Road Networks</strong> folder, the name
of the road network dataset is displayed.

  figKey="figure-135"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure135.png"
  alt="Progress Window"
  caption="Progress Window"
/>

## Edit a Road Network Dataset

Once a road network dataset has been created, the user can edit that road network dataset. To edit a road network dataset, from the LifeSim main
window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Road
Networks</strong> folder, right-click on a road network dataset, and click <strong>Edit</strong> from the shortcut menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-136" />). Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Road
Network Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), point to <strong>Edit</strong>, click a road network dataset.

Either way, the Edit Road Network dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-137" />) opens. [Import from a
Shapefile](./08-road-network-data.mdx#import-from-a-shapefile) provides information on the editor.

## Display a Road Network Dataset

To display a road network dataset, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the
 <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Road Networks</strong> folder, right-click on a road network dataset, from the shortcut menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-136" />), click <strong>Show In Map Window</strong>. The selected road network dataset displays in the map window
of the LifeSim main window.

Also, road network dangles (or line ends that do not share an endpoint with any other line) can be displayed. Dangles are useful for determining
incomplete road networks by being able to quickly identify locations where roads are disconnected when they should be connected (refer to [Appendix
B](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#appendix-b-map-preferences) for details on modifying road networks using dangles). From the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), from the Study tab, from the Study Tree, from the Road Networks folder, right-click on a road network
dataset, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-136" />), click Show Dangles in Map Window. The selected road network dataset's dangles
 will display in the map window of the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />).

Map layer attributes can be accessed for each map layer and is provided in a table for the dataset referenced by the map layer. The road network
dataset must be displayed in the map window before the attribute table can be accessed. To access a specific map layer Attribute table, from the Map
Layers tab, right-click on a map layer of interest, from the shortcut menu, click Open Attribute Table. The Map Layer Attributes dialog box opens;
review [Map Layer Attributes Dialog Box](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#map-layer-attributes-dialog-box) for more information. Editing of the map
layer attributes is detailed in [Editing Map Layer Features and
Attributes](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#editing-map-layer-features-and-attributes).

## Copy a Road Network Dataset

To copy a road network dataset from an existing dataset, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), from the
<strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Road</strong> <strong>Networks</strong> folder,
right-click on a road network dataset, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-136" />), click <strong>Copy</strong>. Another way is from
 the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Road Network Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />),
point to <strong>Copy</strong>, and click a road network dataset.

Either way, the <strong>Name</strong> <strong>of New Study Item</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />) opens. Enter a new name in
the <strong>Name</strong> box. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Name of New Study Item</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />
) closes and the copied road network dataset will display in the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong> under the <strong>Road</strong>
<strong>Networks</strong> folder.

## Delete a Road Network Dataset

To delete a road network dataset from the LifeSim study and study directory files, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />
), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Road Networks</strong> folder, right-click on a road
network dataset, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-136" />), click <strong>Delete</strong>. Another way is from the LifeSim main
window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Road Network Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-129" />), point to
<strong>Delete</strong>, click a road network dataset.

Either way, a <strong>Confirm Delete</strong> window (similar to <FigReference figKey="figure-101" />) opens asking for confirmation to delete the
selected road network dataset. Click <strong>Yes</strong>, the <strong>Confirm Delete</strong> message window closes (similar to
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-101" />), and the selected road network dataset is deleted, and no longer displays in the <strong>Study
Tree</strong> under the <strong>Road Networks</strong> folder.
