# Graphical User Interface

LifeSim is a menu-driven software package that performs life loss and damage analyses. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface,
data entry capabilities, geospatial mapping, and report-quality charts.

The graphical user interface consists of a menu bar, map tool bar, status bar, study data tab, map layers tab, and a map window (<FigReference figKey="gui-overview" />).

  alt="The full graphical user interface of LifeSim, including the study an map layers tabs (left), map window (center), and menu bar at the top."
  caption="LifeSim graphical user interface."
/>

- **Menu Bar** Contains the LifeSim menus.
- **Study and Map Layers Tabs** The Study tab contains a Study Tree that guides users when adding the building blocks of an LifeSim study. The Map Layers tab contains a list of all map layers that are currently part of the active study. Clicking a tab opens the tab specific information and commands.
- **Map Window** Used to graphically display the LifeSim study components and imported map layers, which is geographically referenced (geo-referenced).
- **Map Toolbar** Contains tools used to setup, navigate, and edit within the LifeSim map window.
- **Status Bar** Displays messages related to incoming data, status of the LifeSim software for informational purposes.

## Menu Bar

{/* <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/StudyMenuBar.png"/> */}
The menu bar of LifeSim provides the user with many commands to perform various functions to support the study. An overview for each menu in LifeSim software is provided.

- **File** The File menu allows the user to perform study management functions such as creating, opening, closing, and saving an LifeSim study. Available commands are: Create New, Open Existing, Save,
  Save As, Zip Project, Compress Project and Exit. This menu also displays a list of previously opened LifeSim studies and selecting one automatically opens the selected study.
- **Mapping** From the Mapping menu users can add or remove map layers from the Map Layers tab and map window. Map layers that can be added to an LifeSim study are - .shp, .flt, .tif, .vrt, .gpkg, or
  web layers. Other available functions from the Mapping menu are creating vector layers (.shp) and modifying or importing map projections. Available commands are: Add Map Layer, Add Web Layer, Create New Vector Layer,
  Remove Map Layer, and Map Properties.
- **Study** From the Study menu, users can import, create, modify, and edit the building blocks of an LifeSim study. Commands include Hydraulic Data, Structure Inventories, Emergency Planning Data,
  Road Network Data, Destinations Data, Agricultural Crop Data, ECAM Data, Alternatives and Simulations.
- **Help** Displays a copy of the LifeSim User's Manual current version; and information about LifeSim.

## Study and Map Layers Tabs

LifeSim's input data is organized into two tabs that allow the user to view, enter, and edit LifeSim study data or to view and manipulate any map layer geographically in the map window.

- **Study Tab** Allows a user to view, add, and edit data; and add/remove map layers for an LifeSim study. The Study tab is the default tab and provides a view of the study data in a
  tree (Study Tree). Also, from the Study Tree a user can create, edit, and delete datasets, alternatives and simulations. The Study Tree lists datasets, alternatives and simulations that have been created.
- **Map Layers Tab** The Map Layers tab provides a list of the map layers in a tree (Map Layers Tree). From the Map Layers tab, a user can import, create, edit and delete map layers.
  The Map Layers Tree allows users to also display map layers in the map window. However, only selected layers in the Map Layers tab will display in the map window. The user can turn
  map layers on or off, adjust the properties of the layers, modify the order of the layers for viewing in the map window. Appendix A provides greater detail on the Map Layers tab and associated map window.

## Map Window

The Map Window in LifeSim provides a way to graphically display LifeSim components. This section is designed to give a brief overview of what is available in the map window and map layers.
For more detail on the mapping functionality in LifeSim, refer to Appendix A.

### Map Window Toolbar

The Map Window Toolbar contains general mapping and editing tools. If a tool has a parenthesis after the tooltip, the letter in the parentheses represents a hot
key that allows a user to access the tool through the keyboard. For example, to access the Query tool (Q) through keyboard selections, the user will click the Shift-Q keys in the map window.
This will activate the Query tool. A list of all of the hot keys is located in Appendix A.

#### General Tools

<Figure
  figKey="GeneralMapToolBar"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/GeneralMappingTools.png"
  alt="Map window toolbar that contains options for basic mapping functionality."
  caption="Map window toolbar that contains options for basic mapping functionality."
/>
The General Toolbar includes the Select Tool (B), Pan Tool (P), Zoom In Tool (Z), Zoom to full extents, Add Data, Query Features Tool (Q), and Measure Distance Tool (M). These tools change the appearance of the 
cursor, as well as the functionality of the mouse cursor in the map window.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Select_22x22.png"/> **Select (B)** The Select tool allows the user to select elements displayed in the map window that are 
currently selected in the Selectable Layers. More details on Selectable Layers can be found in the next section. To select features, click on a feature or click, hold, and drag a rectangle around 
features to select them in the map window. Additionally, the Select tool allows users to access shortcut menus which can be used to customize features when in editing mode. Refer Appendix A for more information regarding editing mode.
	
<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Pan_Hand_22x22.png"/> **Pan (P)** The Pan tool allows the user to pan the map window; click the Pan tool and 
click, hold and move the mouse around the map window. Also, if the mouse has a wheel then the user can pan the map window by using the wheel (click and hold the wheel to pan).

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Zoom_In_22x22.png"/> **Zoom In (Z)** The Zoom In tool allows the user to zoom in to areas of the map window. To zoom in, hold the 
mouse button down and outline the area of interest to enlarge. Also, if the mouse has a wheel then the user can zoom in or out using the wheel (wheel up zooms in and wheel down zooms out).

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/ZoomOut.png"/> **Fixed Zoom Out (O)** The Fixed Zoom Out tool zooms out to a fixed distance. Click the Fixed Zoom Out icon once and the 
LifeSim map window view will zoom out a fixed distance. Double-click on the tool icon and the map window view will zoom out twice the fixed distance.

Additionally, the user can perform fixed zoom capabilities by right-clicking anywhere in the map window.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Earth_Icon_22x22.png"/> **Zoom to full extents** The Zoom to full extents tool is a quick way to re-center the map by zooming out to the full 
geo-graphical extent of the map layers in the map window. Web layers do not affect the map extents.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Add_File_22x22.png"/> **Add Data** Click the Add Data tool, the Browse for files browser will open. This browser allows users to navigate to 
layers (including .shp, .flt, .tif, .gpkg, and .vrt) of interest and add the layer(s) to the map window. Click the down arrow  to show a shortcut menu which allows the user to add data, add web imagery, or 
create new data that is added to the map window. 
<Figure

  alt="Add map data tool in the LifeSim map window toolbar."
  caption="Map tool to add map layer data in the LifeSim graphical user interface."
/>

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/IdentifyIcon.png"/> **Query Features Tool (Q)** The Query Features tool identifies the geographic feature or place currently selected in the map window. 
Alternatively, multiple features can be identified by dragging a box over the desired area. Once a selection is made the Feature Query dialog box will open with the information presented in table format separated by Feature 
type. Only visible layers in the map window will be queried and the Selectable Layers option does not modify the Query Features tool.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/measure.png"/> **Measure Distance Tool (M)** The Measure Distance tool allows the user to measure the distance along a specified line. With the tool selected, 
click to initiate the measure line. Each subsequent click will add a new point to the measure line. When finished, double-click on the location of the final point. The Measure Results dialog box will open and display the distance 
in the units the user has chosen (feet, miles, meters, or kilometers).

#### Editing Tools

<Figure

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/MapLayerEditingTools.png"
  alt="Map window toolbar that contains options for editing map features."
  caption="Map window toolbar that contains options for editing map features."
/>
The set of tools located in the Editor Toolbar become activated when a map layer begins an editing session. When a user right-clicks on a map layer in the Map Layers tab, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="editMapLayer" />), 
click Edit, and the tools in the Editor Toolbar become active. Only one map layer can be edited at one time. For lines and polygons, there are two editing modes: feature edit, and vertex edit. Clicking on a feature puts 
the user into the feature edit mode (move, delete, reverse), clicking on a selected feature puts the user in the vertex edit mode (add, delete, edit vertex points).

During an edit session, clicking **_Delete_** will delete all currently selected features or currently selected feature vertices. Clicking the **_R_** key will reverse the direction of a currently selected line feature. Also,
right-click shortcut menu options allow the user to do multiple tasks depending on what is clicked. Detailed information on all of the functionality of the editing tools is available in Appendix A.

  alt="Edit map layer shortcut menu in the LifeSim map layers tab."
  caption="Edit map layer shortcut menu in the LifeSim map layers tab."
/>

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/AddNewFeature.png"/> **Add new features (A)** The Add new features tool allows the user to add a new feature to the editable map layer by left-clicking to add feature data. 
Selected features can be deleted by either clicking the Delete key, or right-click on the selected feature(s) and from the shortcut menu click Delete Selected Features.
	
<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/InsertVertex.png"/> **Insert vertex (I)** The Insert vertex tool allows the user to add a vertex to an existing line or polygon map layer. The Insert vertex tool becomes available when the selected feature is in the 
vertex edit mode. As the cursor gets close to the line or polygon edge the map window will display what the updated feature will look like if a vertex is added at the cursor. Left-click to insert the new vertex.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/BreakLine.png"/> **Split line feature (K)** The split line feature tool will split a line feature into two features at the point the user clicked on the line. The user needs to be in the feature edit mode for this tool to be enabled.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/ContinueFeature.png"/> **Continue line feature** The Continue from end (lines only) tool will continue a line feature from the end point of the line feature to the point to a second point clicked in the map window. Double-click to finish the line 
continuation edits or right-click and choose Finish Editing Vertices or choose a different tool to finish the line continuation. The user needs to be in the vertex edit mode for this tool to be enabled.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/AddNewPart.png"/> **Add new geometry to existing feature** The Add new geometry to existing feature tool will allow the user to add a polygon or line to an existing selected polygon or line feature. To add a hole to a polygon, click to 
add points defining the hole and double-click to finish. The user needs to be in the vertex edit mode for this tool to be enabled.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Magnet_Icon.png"/> **Feature Snapping Settings** The Feature Snapping Settings tool allows the user to define snapping rules when editing. Snapping will automatically move the desired action to the nearest snap point 
when the cursor is close. Snapping can be very useful when trying to line up endpoints of line features or place points directly on top of other features. Enable snapping by clicking the Enable Snapping checkbox. From the 
Snap to Feature list, select the desired feature to snap to, then select how snapping will be applied (all points, end points, or edges).

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Undo.png"/> **Undo (Ctrl + Z)** The Undo tool allows the user to undo changes made during an edit session. Only enabled if there are edits that can be undone.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Redo.png"/> **Redo (Ctrl + Y)** The Redo tool allows the user to redo changes made. Only enabled if there are edits to redo.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/Save.ico"/> **Save Edits (Ctrl + S)** The Save Edits tool will save all edits made during the editing session. Only enabled if edits have been made.

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/StopFeatureEdit.png"/> **Stop Editing** The Stop Editing tool will stop the edit session. At this point a new map layer can be selected for editing. If edits have been made, then the user will be prompted to save them before stopping the edit session.
