# Installing and Starting LifeSim

This chapter describes the recommended computer system requirements for installing and running LifeSim. The software includes a graphical user
interface (GUI), designed to increase the usability and efficiency of the software. The LifeSim GUI provides for file management, data entry and
editing, and viewing output results.

## Requirements

- Installation – about 180MB (megabytes) of hard disk space

- Memory – 1GB (gigabytes) RAM (random access memory); recommended 4GB RAM

- Operating System – Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1/Windows 10

- Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.0

## Installation

- Install LifeSim using the self-extracting setup package file downloaded from the Risk Management Center (RMC) website ().

- The installer (with administrative privileges) will run through a series of steps regarding terms and conditions, install location (e.g.,
<em>C:\Program File</em>s), and shortcut icons.

- Install the LifeSim example dataset from the RMC website ().

## Starting LifeSim

<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-c9097dd1.png" /> When starting the LifeSim, double-click
 the LifeSim icon (shortcut) on the desktop. The main window of the LifeSim will appear (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />). If the desktop shortcut
 icon is not available, the user can start LifeSim from the <strong>Start</strong> menu, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click
<strong>RMC</strong>, and click <strong>LifeSim</strong>.

## Creating a Study

A study in LifeSim is a combination of the data, models, or events required to analyze a specific geographical area. The study represents all the
input data and simulation output required to adequately answer the question of estimating consequences from a hazard. There are two ways to create a
study.

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure1.png"
  alt="LifeSim Main Window"
  caption="LifeSim Main Window"
/>

To create a LifeSim study:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>File</strong> menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-2" />),
click <strong>Create New</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-2" />). Another way is from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, right-click <strong>New
Study</strong>, from the shortcut menu, click <strong>Create New</strong>. Either way, the <strong>Save As</strong> browser will open (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-3" />).

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure2.png"
  alt="LifeSim – File Menu – Create New"
  caption="LifeSim – File Menu – Create New"
/>

1. From the <strong>Save As</strong> browser, navigate to the location (directory) where the LifeSim study will be created. Enter a name (required) in
 the <strong>File name</strong> box.

1. Click <strong>Save</strong>, the <strong>Save</strong> <strong>As</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-3" />) will close. The LifeSim
main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />) will now have the name of the study in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> and the <strong>Title
Bar</strong>.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-3"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure3.png"
  alt="Save As Browser"
  caption="Save As Browser"
/>

1. A directory with the study name and associated files will be created for the study.

## Opening a Study

It is important to note that at this time LifeSim Version 2.0 cannot open or update LifeSim Version 1.0 studies. To open an existing LifeSim study:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>File</strong> menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-2" />),
click <strong>Open Existing</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-2" />). Another way is from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, right-click
<strong>New Study</strong>, from the shortcut menu, click <strong>Open Existing</strong>. Either way, an <strong>Open</strong> browser will open (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-4" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-4"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure4.png"
  alt="Open Browser"
  caption="Open Browser"
/>

1. Browse to the location of the LifeSim study file (<em>&#42;.fia</em>). Click on the <em>&#42;.fia</em> file and the <strong>File</strong>
<strong>name</strong> box will now contain the filename (e.g., <em>LifeSim_Ex_Project_v20.fia</em>).

1. Click <strong>Open</strong>, the <strong>Open</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-4" />) will close and the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />) will now display the selected study in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> and the study name will display in
the <strong>Title Bar</strong>.

## Study Directories and Files

Directories and files are automatically created by LifeSim to store information. As data is entered, subsequent files and subdirectories are created.
A description of the created directories is provided below:

-  LifeSim Example Model: Study folder that is created when a user creates a new study ([Import from
HEC-RAS](./06-hydraulic-data.mdx#import-from-hec-ras))

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-66aafb2d.png" /><strong>Deming Fake Dam
Breach.fia</strong>: File created by LifeSim Version 2.0 when a study is created. Contains the name and description of the study, map properties, and
references to the LifeSim study elements. The *.fia file also holds the following study data:

  - Structure Inventory: Contains all of the information about the imported and defined structure inventory, damage categories and structure occupancy
 types.

  - Emergency Planning Zones (EPZ) Data: Contains all of the information about the imported and defined EPZ data.

  - Road Network: Contains all of the information about the imported and defined road network.

  - Destination Data: Contains the created destination data.

  - Alternative Data: The created alternative is saved as an XML file.

  - Simulations: Contains all of the created and computed simulation data.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-08d7ab9d.png" /> <strong>Hydraulic_Data</strong>:
Sub-directory created by LifeSim when hydraulic data is imported. Contains files that define data items for imported hydraulic data. Also,
sub-directories are created when hydraulic data is defined and are dependent on the hydraulic data import option utilized.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-08d7ab9d.png" /> <strong>Agricultural_Data</strong>:
Sub-directory created by LifeSim when agriculture data is imported. Contains the created agriculture data geotiff.
