# ECAM Data

Economic Consequence Assessment Model (<strong>ECAM</strong>) data is a computable general equilibrium model used to evaluate the impact of shocks to
the economy in terms of reductions in labor and/or capital. LifeSim allows users to access the ECAM model through the internet during simulations. To
use ECAM during an LifeSim simulation, an internet connection is required. In the context of LifeSim, the model is used to evaluate the indirect
economic damages associated with a flood event.

As stated above, the ECAM model requires estimates of the reductions in labor and capital due to flood events. Since labor reduction calculations take
 life loss risks into account, ECAM cannot be run unless the life loss compute option is turned on (review [Create an
Alternative](./12-alternatives.mdx#create-an-alternative)). The labor reductions are based on the number of work hours reduced due to people being
displaced from their homes due to flooding and life loss. Capital reductions are based on the damages to commercial, industrial, and public structures
 and their contents. To convert these to ratios, a total supply of available labor and capital must be provided.

Because ECAM runs each county independently, values for labor and capital must be provided for each county in the study area. The total labor and
capital must represent the total for the whole county, not the portion of the county in the study area. Available capital is entered as the total
value of commercial, industrial and public structures. Labor should be entered as the total under 65 years of age population at all structures at 2AM.
 For more detail on computing indirect damages with ECAM, please refer to the LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 8.

## Import ECAM Data

Next, from the <strong>County Data Source</strong> panel, select the polygon shapefile from the <strong>County Shapefile</strong> list that represents
 the counties in the study area. Select the polygon shapefile from the dropdown
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-31d47eca.png" /> list, which contains all valid
shapefiles added as map layers to the project; alternatively, click the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-458559e3.png" /> button to browse to and open the
appropriate shapefile. Following the county shapefile selection from the <strong>5 Digit FIPS</strong> list, select the appropriate field name (e.g.,
<em>GEOID</em>) that contains the county’s 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code (“SSCCC”, where SS is a two-digit state code
and CCC is a three-digit county code). The county data table (located at the bottom of the ECAM tab) updates with the County FIPS and County Name
attributes contained in the selected shapefile. Enter the Total Capital and Total Labor values for each county in the study area.

ECAM also requires users to enter the flood duration (hours), the reconstruction period duration (hours), and the cleanup period duration (hours). The
 flood duration depends on how quickly the flood waters recede. This data can usually be obtained from a hydraulic model. Currently, the user must
provide a single value for the entire flooded area, so thought and judgment must be given to the definition of this duration time.

The flooding <strong>Duration</strong> depends on characteristics of the river, and the timing of floodwaters receding. Users can get a general idea
of the flood duration for the event from the hydraulic model. The <strong>Reconstruction</strong> <strong>Period</strong> is the average number of
days required to rebuild a damaged area to pre-flood economic conditions. The <strong>Cleanup</strong> <strong>Period</strong> is the average number
of days required to remove debris from flooded area. The reconstruction and cleanup period durations depend on the types of structures located in the
flooded area.

To import and create an ECAM dataset:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-157" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>ECAM Data</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Import ECAM Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-158" />).
Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>ECAM Data</strong>, click <strong>Import ECAM
Data</strong>. Either way, the <strong>ECAM Data Importer</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-159" />) opens.

1. In the <strong>ECAM Data Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-159" />), enter a name for the ECAM dataset.

1. From the <strong>Study Shape Data</strong> dropdown list (<FigReference figKey="figure-159" />) select the desired imported map layer (e.g.,
<em>Ex_Destinations</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-160" />). Alternatively, click the <strong>Browse To</strong>  button to open an
<strong>Open</strong> browser window (<FigReference figKey="figure-141" />). Navigate to the directory where the desired shapefile (e.g.,
<em>&#42;.shp</em>) is located, select the shapefile and click <strong>Open</strong>. The <strong>Open</strong> browser window closes (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-141" />), and the <strong>ECAM Data Importer</strong> displays the selected shapefile in the <strong>Study Shape
Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-159" />) list.

1. The <strong>Study Shape Data</strong> selection updates the table in the <strong>County Data</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-160" />)
 with a list of the counties retrieved from the selected <strong>Study Shape Data</strong> (e.g., <em>Ex_Destinations</em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-160" />). The county data is retrieved based on the selected bounding polygon shapefile.

1. In other words, LifeSim filters the list of counties to only include areas within a boundary polygon created based on the selected study area’s
top, bottom, left and right geometric extent.

1. The ECAM model requires estimates of the reductions in labor and capital due to flood events and runs each county independently. Therefore, for the
 desired counties in the <strong>County Data</strong> table (<FigReference figKey="figure-160" />), enter the <strong>Total Capital ($)</strong> and
<strong>Total</strong> <strong>Labor</strong> <strong>Workforce</strong> values. Note, labor should be entered as the total population under 65 years
of age at all structures at night (2AM).

1. At the bottom of the <strong>ECAM Data Importer</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-160" />), enter the <strong>Duration</strong>
<strong>(Hours)</strong> of the flood, and the <strong>Reconstruction (Hours)</strong> and <strong>Cleanup (Hours)</strong> after the flood event.
These estimates are used to calculate the labor reductions based on the number of work hours reduced due to and following the event.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>ECAM Data Importer</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-160" />) closes and LifeSim imports
the ECAM data. <strong>NOTE:</strong> In LifeSim Version 2.0 users can view but cannot modify the entered duration, reconstruction, and cleanup hours
after creating the ECAM dataset.

## View ECAM Data

Users can view the ECAM dataset from the Map Layers tab in the map window. Created ECAM data can be copied or deleted, viewed, and/or displayed in the
