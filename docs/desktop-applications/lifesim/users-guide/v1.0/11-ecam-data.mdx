# ECAM Data

Economic Consequence Assessment Model (<strong>ECAM</strong>) data is a computable general equilibrium model used to evaluate the impact of shocks to
the economy in terms of reductions in labor and/or capital. LifeSim allows users to access the ECAM model through the internet during simulations. To
use ECAM during an LifeSim simulation, an internet connection is required. In the context of LifeSim, the model is used to evaluate the indirect
economic damages associated with a flood event.

As stated above, the ECAM model requires estimates of the reductions in labor and capital due to flood events. Since labor reduction calculations take
life loss risks into account, ECAM cannot be run unless the life loss compute option is turned on (review Section [Create an
Alternative](./12-alternatives.mdx#create-an-alternative)). The labor reductions are based on the number of work hours reduced due to people being
displaced from their homes due to flooding and life loss. Capital reductions are based on the damages to commercial, industrial, and public structures
and their contents. To convert these to ratios, a total supply of available labor and capital must be provided.

Because ECAM runs each county independently, values for labor and capital must be provided for each county in the study area. The total labor and
capital must represent the total for the whole county, not the portion of the county in the study area. Available capital is entered as the total
value of commercial, industrial and public structures. Labor should be entered as the total under 65 years of age population at all structures at 2AM.
For more detail on computing indirect damages with ECAM, please refer to the *LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 8*.

## Import ECAM Data

From the *County Data Source* panel, select the polygon shapefile from the <strong>County Shapefile</strong> list that represents
the counties in the study area. Select the polygon shapefile from the dropdown
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-31d47eca.png" /> list, which 
contains all valid shapefiles added as map layers to the project; alternatively, click the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-output-file.png" /> button to browse 
to and open the appropriate shapefile. Following the county shapefile selection from the <strong>5 Digit FIPS</strong> list, select 
the appropriate field name (e.g., <em>GEOID</em>) that contains the county’s 5-digit Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) code (“SSCCC”, where SS is a two-digit state code
and CCC is a three-digit county code). The county data table (located at the bottom of the ECAM tab) updates with the 
County FIPS and County Name
attributes contained in the selected shapefile. Enter the Total Capital and Total Labor values for each county in the study area.

ECAM also requires users to enter the flood duration (hours), the reconstruction period duration (hours), and the cleanup period duration (hours). The
flood duration depends on how quickly the flood waters recede. This data can usually be obtained from a hydraulic model. Currently, the user must
provide a single value for the entire flooded area, so thought and judgment must be given to the definition of this duration time.

The flooding <strong>Duration</strong> depends on characteristics of the river and the timing of floodwaters receding. 
Users can get a general idea
of the flood duration for the event from the hydraulic model. The <strong>Reconstruction Period</strong> is the average number of
days required to rebuild a damaged area to pre-flood economic conditions. The <strong>Cleanup Period</strong> is the average number
of days required to remove debris from flooded area. The reconstruction and cleanup period durations depend on the types of structures located in the
flooded area.

## View ECAM Data

Users can view the ECAM dataset in the map window from the **Map Layers** tab.
Created ECAM data can be copied or deleted, viewed, and/or displayed in the
map window.

### View ECAM Data

To view the duration, reconstruction, and cleanup hours for an ECAM dataset, from the LifeSim main window, from 
the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the *Study Tree*, under <strong>ECAM Data</strong>,
right-click an ECAM dataset (e.g., <strong>Indirect_Economic</strong> in <FigReference figKey="figure-164" />).

### View Attributes Table

Map layer attributes can be accessed for each map layer and is provided in a table for the dataset referenced by the map layer. The ECAM dataset must
be displayed in the map window before the attribute table can be accessed. To access a specific map layer's attribute table, from the **Map Layers** tab,
right-click on a map layer of interest. From the shortcut menu, click **Open Attribute Table** (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />). The *Map Layer
Attributes* dialog box opens; review Section [Map Layer Attributes Dialog Box](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#map-layer-attributes-dialog-box) for more
information.

### Edit Attributes Table

From the opened *Attribute Table* for the ECAM dataset, click the **Start Feature 
Edit Session** <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-start-edit.png"/> button to edit the total capital ($) and 
total labor values by
county. Further information regarding editing the map layer attributes is provided in Section [Editing Map Layer Features and
Attributes](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#editing-map-layer-features-and-attributes).

## Copy an ECAM Dataset

To copy an ECAM dataset from an existing dataset, from the LifeSim main window, from the **Study** tab, from the *Study Tree*, under **ECAM Data**, right-click 
an ECAM dataset (e.g., **Indirect_Economic** in <FigReference figKey="figure-164" />). From the shortcut menu, click **Copy**. The *Name of New Study Item* dialog 
box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />) opens. Enter a new
name in the **Name** box. Click **OK**, the *Name of New Study Item* dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />) closes, and the copied ECAM dataset
displays in the *Study Tree*.

## Delete an ECAM Dataset

To delete a ECAM dataset from the LifeSim study and study directory files, from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the *Study Tree*, 
under <strong>ECAM Data</strong>,
right-click an ECAM dataset (e.g., **Indirect_Economic** in <FigReference figKey="figure-164" />). From the shortcut menu, 
click <strong>Delete</strong>. A *Confirm Delete* message window (similar to <FigReference figKey="figure-159" />) opens asking for confirmation to 
delete the selected ECAM dataset. Click <strong>Yes</strong>, the *Confirm Delete* message window closes, and the selected ECAM dataset is deleted
and no longer displays in the *Study Tree*.
