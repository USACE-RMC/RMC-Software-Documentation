# Emergency Planning Data

The next step in building an LifeSim study is to add **emergency planning data** which represents an area (or areas) with potentially
unique overall evacuation effectiveness such as evacuation preparedness, community awareness, and the types of flood warning systems available. Refer
to Sorensen et. al. (2014a; 2014b; and 2014c) for examples of how to define an emergency planning zone (EPZ) or area (Appendix C). The effectiveness
of the warning systems available and the anticipated community responses is captured in community diffusion curves for first warning alert and
protective action initiation (sometimes called mobilization).

Central to the evacuation process in LifeSim are the first alert and Protective Action Initiation (PAI) community diffusion curves (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />). The first alert curves represent the percentage of the population that receives a notification of the
warning over time (e.g., fifty percent of the population will receive a warning alert within forty minutes of warning issuance). First alert curves
are entered for daytime and night-time scenarios because the speed at which a first alert can be received can vary significantly between daytime and
night-time. The PAI curves represent the percent of population that takes protective action over time. For example, fifty percent of the population
will have taken protective action within eight minutes of a first alert (Sorensen et. al., 2014c; Appendix C). The diffusion curves can be entered
with uncertainty and LifeSim performs curve sampling on an iteration basis in the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Warning And Protective Action Data Editor

The **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) allows users to edit pre-set warning and
evacuation parameters that were developed using the findings of Sorensen & Mileti <Citation citationKey="SorensenMileti2018"/>. Users are able to adjust these parameters or create new warning
and evacuation parameters to better reflect the specific situation in the study area. Modifications made in the **Warning And Protective Action
Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) is available for all emergency planning zone datasets in the **Emergency Planning
Zone Editor** (discussed in [EPZ Editor](#emergency-planning-zone-epz-editor)).

<Figure

  caption="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – Warning Issuance Delay Tab"
/>

### Overview

Open the Warning And Protective Action Data Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />), from the Study Tree, under Emergency Planning Zones,
right-click Warning And Protective Action Data and from the shortcut menu, click Edit Warning and PAI Data (<FigReference figKey="figure-108" />).

The Warning And Protective Action Data Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) contains three tabs: Warning Issuance Delay, First Alert, and
Protective Action Initiation; each tab is discussed in [Warning Issuance Delay](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#warning-issuance-delay), [First Alert
Curves](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#first-alert-curves), and [Protective Action Initiation
(PAI)](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#protective-action-initiation-pai); respectively. The tabs contain the same buttons for adding, deleting, and
copying existing warning and evacuation parameters and plot windows for viewing the warning and protective action curves. Review [Customizing Plots
and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting tools (located on
the right side of the plot window) and for customizing the plots.

#### Buttons

- **Add New:** **Add New** allows a user to create a warning
  issuance delay, first alert relationship, or new protective action initiation relationship.
  For example, click the **Add New** button from the **
  First
  ** **Alert** tab ({"\n"}
  <FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) opens the ** Name of New First Alert
  Relationship ** dialog box ({"\n"}
  <FigReference figKey="figure-109" />
  ). In **Name** box, enter a name for the new warning issuance delay, first
  alert relationship, or new protective action initiation relationship. Click
  **OK**, the ** Name of New First Alert Relationship ** dialog box ({"\n"}
  <FigReference figKey="figure-109" />) closes and the new warning issuance delay,
  first alert relationship, or new protective action initiation relationship is created.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-109"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure109.png"
  alt="Name of New First Alert Relationship Dialog Box"
  caption="Name of New First Alert Relationship Dialog Box"
/>

- **Delete:** **Delete** allows the user to delete selected
  warning issuance delay, first alert relationship, or new protective action initiation
  relationship. From the **
  Warning And Protective Action Data Editor
  ** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) select a warning issuance delay,
  first alert relationship, or new protective action initiation relationship from
  the dropdown menu (e.g., _Well Prepared_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-107" />
  ). Click **Delete**, a **Confirm Delete** window
  (like
  {"\n"}

  <FigReference figKey="figure-101" />) opens asking the user for confirmation
  to delete the selected item. Click **Yes**, to close the ** Confirm Delete **
  message window (<FigReference figKey="figure-101" />) and delete the selected
  warning issuance delay, first alert relationship, or new protective action
  initiation relationship.

- **Copy:** **Copy** allows the user to copy a warning
  issuance delay, first alert relationship, or new protective action initiation relationship
  with a new name. From the **
  Warning And Protective Action Data Editor
  ** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) select a warning issuance delay,
  first alert relationship, or new protective action initiation relationship from
  the dropdown menu (e.g., _Well Prepared_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-107" />
  ). For example, from the **Warning Issuance Delay** tab click **
  Copy
  **
  , the **Name of New Warning Issuance Delay**
  dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-110" />) opens. By default, the
  selected warning and evacuation parameters name is entered in the
  **Name** box and appended with “
  _**\_Copy**_
  ”. Keep the default name or enter a new name in the **Name** box. Click **OK**,
  the ** Name of New Warning Issuance Delay ** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-110" />
  ) closes and the new copied warning issuance delay, first alert relationship, or
  new protective action initiation relationship is created.

  alt="Copy – Name of New Warning Issuance Delay Dialog Box"
  caption="Copy – Name of New Warning Issuance Delay Dialog Box"
/>

### Warning Issuance Delay

The Warning Issuance Delay tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) allows the user to create a new or edit an existing pre-set warning issuance
delay. The warning issuance delay is the time it takes from when the emergency managers receive the notification of the imminent hazard, or imminent
hazard ID time ([Compute Options for an Alternative](./12-alternatives.mdx#compute-options-for-an-alternative)), to when an evacuation order is issued
to the public.

#### Create a New Warning Issuance Delay

To create a new warning issuance delay:

1. Click the **Add New** <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-298be86c.png" />
   button (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). The **Name of New Warning Issuance Delay** dialog box (similar to
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-109" />) opens.

1. In **Name** box, enter a name for the new warning issuance delay. Click **OK**, the **Name of New Warning Issuance
   Delay** dialog box (similar to <FigReference figKey="figure-109" />) closes and the new warning issuance delay is created.

1. From the **Warning Issuance Delay (Minutes)** panel, select the desired uncertainty type from the **Uncertainty**
   **Type** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) dropdown menu and
   define the amount of time (in minutes) it could take for the emergency managers
   to issue the warning to the public. The uncertainty options include:

- **None** – (most likely),

- **Lindell** – (A, B),

- **Triangular** – (minimum, most likely, maximum),

- **Normal** – (most likely, standard deviation), and

- **Uniform** – (minimum, maximum).

1. For example, if the emergency manager for an EPZ took anywhere between 15 to 30 minutes to verify the hazard and initiate a public evacuation
   order, then the user would enter a warning issuance delay function with a uniform distribution (<FigReference figKey="figure-111" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-111"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure111.png"
  alt="Warning Issuance Delay – Uniform Uncertainty Type Example"
  caption="Warning Issuance Delay – Uniform Uncertainty Type Example"
/>

1. Click **OK** to save the new warning issuance delay and close the **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />).

#### Edit a Warning Issuance Delay

To edit an existing warning issuance delay, select the desired warning issuance delay name, from the **Warning Issuance Delay** dropdown
menu (e.g., _Well Prepared_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). From the **Warning Issuance Delay (Minutes)** panel, select
the desired uncertainty type from the **Uncertainty** **Type** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) dropdown menu and
define the amount of time (in minutes) it could take for the emergency managers to issue the warning to the public.

To view all of the default warning issuance delay curves, check the checkbox to **Display default Warning Issuance Delay Curves**; all
the default curves will display in the **Warning Issuance Delay** plot window. Click **OK** to save the new warning issuance
delay and close the **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />).

### First Alert Curves

From the **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />), select the **First Alert**
tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />). The first alert curves, alternatively known as warning diffusion (<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />),
represent the percentage of the population that receives a notification of the warning over time (e.g., fifty percent of the population will receive
a warning alert within forty minutes of warning issuance). First alert curves are entered for daytime (from the **Daytime First Alert**
tab) and night-time (from the **Night-time First Alert** tab) scenarios because the speed at which a first alert can be received can vary
significantly between daytime and night-time.

#### Daytime First Alert

The **Daytime First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />) allows the user to set a unique (for multiple zones, when
present) warning system with uncertainty to define the diffusion curve. The diffusion curve represents the percentage of the population which will
receive a first alert warning over time during daytime hours from when the warning was issued and can be described with uncertainty (e.g.,

_**Triangular**_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-112" />
).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-112"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure112.png"
  alt="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – First Alert Tab – Daytime First Alert"
  caption="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – First Alert Tab – Daytime First Alert"
/>

#### Night-time First Alert

**Night-time First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />
) allows the user to set a unique (for multiple zones, when present) warning
system with uncertainty to define the diffusion curve. The diffusion curve
represents the percentage of the population which will receive a first alert
warning over time during night-time hours from when the warning was issued and
can be described with uncertainty. The default curves take into account the
challenges with sending out a warning at night (

<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />
).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-113"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure113.png"
  alt="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – First Alert Tab – Night-time First Alert"
  caption="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – First Alert Tab – Night-time First Alert"
/>

#### Create New First Alert Diffusion Curves

To create a new set of first alert diffusion curves:

1. From the **First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />), click the **Add New**
   {"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-298be86c.png" /> button (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). The **Name of New First Alert Relationship** dialog box (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-109" />) opens.

1. In **Name** box, enter a name for the new first alert relationship. Click **OK**, the **Name of New First Alert
   Relationship** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-109" />) closes and the new first alert relationship is created.

1. From the **Daytime First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />), select the desired distribution from the

   **Distribution** **Type** (<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />

   ) dropdown menu. The distribution options include:

- **None** – (percent warned),

- **Triangular** – (most likely, minimum, maximum),

- **Uniform** – (minimum, maximum),

- **Normal** – (average, standard deviation), and

- **Lognormal** – (average, standard deviation).

1. Define the daytime diffusion curve by entering the time (minutes) and percent warned in the **Daytime First Alert Table** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />). Diffusion curve values can be entered by hand, copied from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®)
   and pasted into the table (i.e., entire table, individual cells, columns, rows). From the **Daytime First Alert Table** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />), right-click to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />), from the shortcut menu the
   user can add, insert, and delete row(s); select all; copy or copy with headers; and paste.
   The daytime first alert table can also be copied (with or without headers) into another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) for saving. Use

   **Ctrl + A** (or the **Select** **
   All
   ** command from the shortcut menu), right-click and select **
   Copy w/ Headers
   **
   . Then paste the data in the desired application to save. Errors in the daytime
   diffusion curve are highlighted in red in the table and a tooltip displays a message
   describing the error ({"\n"}

   <FigReference figKey="figure-95" />
   ). Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut menu (
   <FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) to sort the table in ascending or
   descending order, or clear the table sorting.

1. Next, from the **Night-time First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />), select the desired distribution from the

   **Distribution** **Type** (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />

   ) dropdown menu. The distribution options are the same as in the \*\*
   Daytime

   \*\* **First** **Alert** tab.

1. Define the night-time diffusion curve by entering the time (minutes) and percent warned in the **Night-time First Alert Table** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />).

1. Click **OK** to save the new first alert diffusion curves and close the **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />).

#### Edit First Alert Diffusion Curves

Diffusion curves can be edited for both the daytime and night-time first alert curves, or individually modified. To edit existing first alert
diffusion curves, select the desired diffusion curve set, from the **First Alert Diffusion** dropdown menu (e.g., _Moderate_ in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />). Select the appropriate tab (**Daytime First Alert** tab or **Night-time First
Alert** tab), either begin editing the values in the table or select the desired distribution from the **Distribution**

**Type** dropdown menu and define the first alert diffusion curve. Click **
OK
** to save edits and close the **
Warning And Protective Action Data Editor
** (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />
).

### Protective Action Initiation (PAI)

The **Protective Action Initiation** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />) allows the user to define new or edit existing
mobilization protective action initiation (PAI) delay diffusion curve with or without uncertainty. The PAI delay represents the percentage of the
population which will take protective action over time from when the first alert is received (<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />). During the PAI
delay, people are confirming the severity of the situation, packing, notifying others, protecting property, gathering family and pets, etc.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-114"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure114.png"
  alt="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – Protective Action Initiation Tab"
  caption="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – Protective Action Initiation Tab"
/>

LifeSim provides nine default PAI delay curves; the curves are categorized based on a combination of three emergency management agency preparedness
categories and three categories defining the public perception of the level of risk. The emergency management agency preparedness categories are:

- **Good** – The emergency management agency is well-prepared to issue
  a well-crafted and convincing message to the public that motivates the population
  receiving the message to act.

- **Poor** – The emergency management agency is not well-prepared to
  issue an effective message to the public.

- **Unknown** – This is an average condition between good and poor is
  assumed with the full range of uncertainty of both categories.

The public perception of the level of risk is generally a function of the individual or group’s distance from the hazard (e.g., dam or river). Other
factors that can influence public perception is the frequency and severity of recent events and extremely effective and persistent public awareness
campaigns.

The public perception of the level of risk categories are:

- **Unlikely to impact** – The community at risk has a general perception
  that the warning will not affect them. When considering distance to the hazard
  location, this category could be used when the population is greater than 0.25
  miles from the river or greater than 0.5 miles from the dam.

- **Likely to impact** – The community at risk has a general perception
  that the event will likely affect them. When considering distance to the hazard
  location, this category could be used when the population is less than 0.25 miles
  from the river or less than 0.5 miles from the dam.

- **Unknown** – This is an average condition between unlikely to impact
  and likely to impact is assumed with the full range of uncertainty of both categories.

#### Create New Protective Action Initiation

To create a new protective action initiation relationship:

1. From **Protective Action Initiation** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />), click the **Add New**
   {"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-298be86c.png" /> button. The **Name of New
   Protective Action Initiation** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-115" />) opens.

1. In **Name** box, enter a name for the new protective action initiation relationship. Click **OK**, the **Name of
   New Protective Action Initiation** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-115" />) closes and the new PAI relationship is created.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-115"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure115.png"
  alt="Name of New Protective Action Initiation Dialog Box"
  caption="Name of New Protective Action Initiation Dialog Box"
/>

1. From the **Protective Action Initiation** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />), select the desired distribution from the

   **Distribution** **Type** (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />

   ) dropdown menu. The distribution options include:

- **None** – (percent initiated),

- **Triangular** – (most likely, minimum, maximum),

- **Uniform** – (minimum, maximum),

- **Normal** – (average, standard deviation), and

- **Lognormal** – (average, standard deviation).

1. Define the daytime diffusion curve by entering the time (minutes) and percent initiated to take action in the **PAI Table** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />). Diffusion curve values can be entered by hand, copied from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®)
   and pasted into the table (i.e., entire table, individual cells, columns, rows). From the **PAI Table** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />), right-click to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />), from the shortcut menu the
   user can add, insert, and delete row(s); select all; copy or copy with headers; and paste.
   The PAI table can also be copied (with or without headers) into another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) for saving. Use **Ctrl + A**
   (or the **Select** **All** command from the shortcut menu), right-click and select **Copy w/ Headers**. Then
   paste the data in the desired application to save.
   Errors in the PAI diffusion curve are highlighted in red in the table and a tooltip displays a message describing the error (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />). Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) to sort the
   table in ascending or descending order, or clear the table sorting.

1. Click **OK** to save the new PAI diffusion curve and close the **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />).

#### Edit Protective Action Initiation

To edit an existing PAI diffusion curve, select the desired protective action delay relationship, from the **Protective Action Delay**
dropdown menu (e.g., _Preparedness: Poor / Perception: Unknown_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-114" />). Either begin editing the values in
the PAI table or select the desired distribution from the **Distribution** **Type** dropdown menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />) and define the PAI diffusion curve. Click **OK** to save edits and close the **Warning
And Protective Action Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />).

## Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) Editor

The **Emergency Planning Zone Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />) allows the user to import an emergency planning zones
(EPZ) dataset and enter information defining separate warning and evacuation parameters per EPZ. In most cases, separate emergency management agency
areas within the study area are modeled as unique emergency planning zones since the warning issuance efficiency, message content, and public response
can vary (<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />).

Users import the emergency planning zone dataset from a polygon shapefile where each polygon feature in the shapefile represents an emergency planning
zone. Multiple EPZ datasets can be imported and defined. The warning and evacuation parameters cannot be modified in the **Emergency Planning
Zone Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />); however, selecting the **Edit** **Data**
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" /> button opens the **Warning
And Protective Action Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) which allows users to edit and define warning and protective action
parameters.

Note, the Emergency Planning Zone Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />) opens when editing imported EPZ datasets (refer to [Edit an EPZ
Dataset](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#edit-an-epz-dataset)) but the Import Emergency Planning Zone editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />)
opens when importing a new EPZ dataset (refer to [Create and Define an EPZ
Dataset](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#create-and-define-an-epz-dataset)).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-116"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure116.png"
  alt="Example – Emergency Planning Zone Editor"
  caption="Example – Emergency Planning Zone Editor"
/>

### EPZ Editor Overview

The tabs on the Emergency Planning Zone Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />) represent the warning delay and the first alert and PAI
diffusion curves that need to be created for the emergency planning zones. The Emergency Planning Zone Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />)
contains four tabs: Warning Issuance Delay, First Alert, and Protective Action Initiation, and Issuance To Initiation. The first three tabs contain
the same buttons for editing the warning and evacuation parameters. The Edit Data button opens the Warning And Protective Action Data Editor (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). All four tabs contain the same general plotting tools (located on the right side of the plot window) for
customizing the plots (review [Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for more
information).

### Create and Define an EPZ Dataset

In most cases, separate emergency management agency areas within the study area are modeled as unique emergency planning zones since the warning
issuance efficiency, message content, and public response can vary.

#### Import EPZ from Polygon Shapefile

To create emergency planning zones from a point shapefile:

1. From the LifeSim main window, from the **Study** tab, from the **Study Tree**, right-click on **Emergency Planning
   Zones**, from the shortcut menu click **Import Emergency Planning Zones From Shapefile** (<FigReference figKey="figure-117" />).
   Another way from the LifeSim main window is from the **Study** menu, point to **Emergency Planning Data**, click
   **Import From Shapefile** (<FigReference figKey="figure-118" />
   ).

1. Either way, the **Import Emergency Planning Zone** editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />) opens. Enter a name for the
   emergency planning zone in the **Name** box (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />).

1. To select the shapefile that contains information about the emergency planning zone, to the right of the **Emergency Planning Zone Polygon
   Shapefile** dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />), click . An **Open** browser (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-120" />) opens, navigate to the directory where the polygon shapefile is located. Select the correct polygon
   shapefile (e.g., _\*.shp_) and click **Open**; the **Open** browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-120" />) closes and
   the user will be returned to the **Import Emergency Planning Zone** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />). Alternatively,
   if the desired shapefile has already been imported as a map layer into the LifeSim study, then from the **Emergency Planning Zone Polygon
   Shapefile** dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />), select the desired map layer.

1. From the **Emergency Planning Zone Name Field** (<FigReference figKey="figure-121" />) dropdown menu select the shapefile attribute
   that is representative of the unique emergency planning zone (e.g., _ID_NAME_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-121" />). The list of items in
   the **Emergency Planning Zone Name Field** (<FigReference figKey="figure-121" />) dropdown menu is generated from the selected emergency
   planning zone shapefile.

1. The **Emergency Planning Zone Name Field** dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />) selection updates the

   **Emergency Planning Zone** dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />

   ) to contain the names of all of the zones (polygons) in the selected
   shapefile. The user must define the warning and evacuation parameters to
   reflect the specific situation in each zone in the study area.

The following steps must be completed for every EPZ area in the **Emergency Planning Zone** dropdown menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />).

1. By default, the **Simulation Traffic (If Applicable)** option is turned on (the checkbox is checked) to simulate traffic in the
   selected EPZ. However, the traffic simulation process can be intensive and take a long time to compute. Therefore, if an area is unlikely to require
   simulating traffic along evacuation routes, for groups taking protective action, then turn off the **Simulation Traffic (If Applicable)**
   option by unchecking the checkbox.

#### Define Warning Issuance Delay

1. From the **Warning Issuance Delay** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-121" />) the user will provide parameters that define the
   amount of time it could take for emergency managers to issue a warning to the public. From the **Warning Issuance Delay** list (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-121" />) a select the appropriate warning issuance delay curve for the selected EPZ area (e.g., _Cloverdale_
   in <FigReference figKey="figure-121" />).

1. The user can also edit and delete existing curves; and/or create, delete, and add user defined curves by clicking the **Edit**

   **Data** <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" /> button
   to open the **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />
   ); refer to [Warning and Protective Action Data
   Editor](#warning-and-protective-action-data-editor) for more information.

1. To view all of the default warning issuance delay curves, from the **Import Emergency Planning Zone** dialog box (
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-121" />), check the checkbox to **Display default Warning Issuance Delay Curves**; all the default
   curves will display in the **Warning Issuance Delay** plot window (<FigReference figKey="figure-121" />).

#### Select First Alert Diffusion Curves

From the **First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-122" />) the user will provide parameters that define the warning diffusion
curves for daytime (from the **Daytime First Alert** tab) and night-time (from the **Night-time First Alert** tab)
scenarios. First alert curves are separated into daytime and night-time scenarios because the speed at which a first alert can be received can vary
significantly between daytime and night-time.

  alt="Import Emergency Planning Zones – Daytime First Alert Tab – Warning Diffusion Curves"
  caption="Import Emergency Planning Zones – Daytime First Alert Tab – Warning Diffusion Curves"
/>

1. From the **First Alert Diffusion** dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-122" />), select the appropriate first alert diffusion
   curves; the selection sets the daytime and night-time curves for the selected EPZ area (e.g., _Cloverdale_ in
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-122" />).

1. The user can also edit and delete existing curves; and/or create, delete, and add user defined curves by clicking the **Edit**
   **Data** <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" /> button
   to open the **Warning And Protective Action Data Editor** (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />
   ); refer to [Warning and Protective Action Data
   Editor](#warning-and-protective-action-data-editor) for more information.

#### Set Protective Action Initiation Function

1.  From the **Protective Action Initiation** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-123" />) select the appropriate curve from the

    {" "}

    {" "}
    **Protective Action Delay** dropdown menu (

    <FigReference figKey="figure-123" />

    ) to define the PAI response curve for the selected EPZ area (e.g., \_
    Cloverdale

          _ in <FigReference figKey="figure-123" />

    ).

1.  The user can also edit and delete existing curves; and/or create, delete, and add user defined curves by clicking the **Edit**

#### View the Combined Warning and Evacuation Curve

The issuance to initiation tab provides a visualization of the combined warning and mobilization function. It is the % of population that will take
protective action over time once the warning is issued. It also provides a way for the user to display the combined uncertainty of the warning and
protective action functions. The combined function is a concise way to present the evacuation response to warning issuance.

1. View the combined warning and evacuation curve for the selected EPZ area (e.g., _Cloverdale_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-123" />) by
   selecting the **Issuance To Initation** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-124" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-124"

  alt="Import Emergency Planning Zones – Issuance To Initiation Tab"
  caption="Import Emergency Planning Zones – Issuance To Initiation Tab"
/>

1. From the bottom of **Issuance To Initation** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-124" />), modify the combined warning and evacuation
   plot by entering values for the **Curve** **Samples**, **Timestep (minutes), **and** First Alert
   **time. View the summary plot for the daytime or night-time scenarios by selecting _**Day**_ or
   _**Night**_
   , from the **First** **Alert** dropdown menu (
   <FigReference figKey="figure-124" />
   ). Modifying the values does not impact the simulation, only the combined warning
   and evacuation visualization is impacted.

#### Save the New EPZ Dataset

1. Continue to set the warning and protective action parameters for every emergency planning zone in the selected shapefile; and therefore, listed in
   the **Emergency Planning Zone** dropdown menu (e.g., _Cloverdale_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-124" />).

1. Once all of the correct information for the EPZ dataset has been entered (e.g., _Example_EPZ_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-124" />),
   click **OK**. The **Import Emergency Planning Zone** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-124" />) closes. From the
   LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-118" />), from the **Study Tree**, under the **Emergency Planning Zones**
   folder, the name of the EPZ dataset will display (e.g., _Example_EPZ_ in <FigReference figKey="figure-118" />).

### Edit an EPZ Dataset

Once an EPZ dataset has been created, the user can edit that EPZ dataset from the **Emergency Planning Zone Editor** (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />). From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-118" />), from the **Study**
tab, from the **Study Tree**, from the **Emergency Planning Zones** folder, right-click on an EPZ dataset, from the shortcut
menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-125" />), click **Edit**. Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the

**Study** menu, point to **Emergency Planning Data**,
