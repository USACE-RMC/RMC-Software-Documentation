# Emergency Planning Data

The next step in building an LifeSim study is to add **emergency planning data** which represents an area (or areas) with potentially
unique overall evacuation effectiveness such as evacuation preparedness, community awareness, and the types of flood warning systems available. Refer
to Sorensen et. al. (<Citation citationKey="SorensenMileti2014a"/>, <Citation citationKey="SorensenMileti2014b"/>, <Citation citationKey="SorensenMileti2014c"/>) for 
examples of how to define an emergency planning zone (EPZ) or area. The effectiveness
of the warning systems available and the anticipated community responses is captured in community diffusion curves for first warning alert and
protective action initiation (sometimes called mobilization).

Central to the evacuation process in LifeSim are the first alert and Protective Action Initiation (PAI) community 
diffusion curves (<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />). The first alert curves represent the percentage of the population that receives a notification of the
warning over time (e.g., fifty percent of the population will receive a warning alert within forty minutes of warning issuance). First alert curves
are entered for daytime and night-time scenarios because the speed at which a first alert can be received can vary significantly between daytime and
night-time. The PAI curves represent the percent of population that takes protective action over time. For example, fifty percent of the population
will have taken protective action within eight minutes of a first alert <Citation citationKey="SorensenMileti2014c"/>. The diffusion curves can be entered
with uncertainty and LifeSim performs curve sampling on an iteration basis in the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Warning And Protective Action Data Editor

The *Warning And Protective Action Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) allows users to edit pre-set warning and
evacuation parameters that were developed using the findings of Sorensen & Mileti <Citation citationKey="SorensenMileti2015"/>. Users are able to adjust 
these parameters or create new warning
and evacuation parameters to better reflect the specific situation in the study area. Modifications made in the *Warning And Protective Action
Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) is available for all emergency planning zone datasets in the *Emergency Planning
Zone Editor* (discussed in [EPZ Editor](#emergency-planning-zone-epz-editor)).

### Overview

Open the *Warning And Protective Action Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). From the *Study Tree*, under **Emergency Planning Zones**,
right-click **Warning And Protective Action Data**. From the shortcut menu, click **Edit Warning and PAI Data** (<FigReference figKey="figure-108" />).

  caption="LifeSim Study Tree – Emergency Planning Zones – Edit Warning and PAI Data Shortcut Command"
/>

The *Warning And Protective Action Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) contains three tabs: **Warning Issuance Delay**, **First Alert**, and
**Protective Action Initiation**; each tab is discussed in [Warning Issuance Delay](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#warning-issuance-delay), [First Alert
Curves](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#first-alert-curves), and [Protective Action Initiation
(PAI)](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#protective-action-initiation-pai); respectively. The tabs contain the same buttons for adding, deleting, and
copying existing warning and evacuation parameters and plot windows for viewing the warning and protective action curves. Review [Customizing Plots
and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting tools (located on
the right side of the plot window) and for customizing the plots.

### Warning Issuance Delay

The **Warning Issuance Delay** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) allows the user to create a new or edit an existing pre-set warning issuance
delay. The warning issuance delay is the time it takes from when the emergency managers receive the notification of the imminent hazard -- or imminent
hazard ID time (review [Compute Options for an Alternative](./12-alternatives.mdx#compute-options-for-an-alternative)) -- to when an evacuation order is issued
to the public.

#### Create a New Warning Issuance Delay

To create a new warning issuance delay:

<ProcessList
  items={[
    { // STEP 1
      title: (
        <>
          Click the <strong>Add New</strong> <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-occ-add.png" /> button
          (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). The <em>Name of New Warning Issuance Delay</em> dialog box (similar to <FigReference figKey="figure-109" />) opens.
        </>
      ),
    },
    { // STEP 2
      title: (
        <>
          In <strong>Name</strong> box, enter a name for the new warning issuance delay. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and the <em>Name of New Warning Issuance
          Delay</em> dialog box closes and the new warning issuance delay is created.
        </>
      ),
    },
    { // STEP 3
      title: (
        <>
          From the <strong>Warning Issuance Delay (Minutes)</strong> green panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />), select the desired uncertainty type from the <strong>Uncertainty
          Type</strong> dropdown menu and
          define the amount of time (in minutes) it is estimated to take for the emergency managers
          to issue the warning to the public. The uncertainty options include:
        </>
      ),
      child: [
        {
          title: (
            <>
              <strong>None</strong>: (most likely).
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          title: (
            <>
              <strong>Lindell</strong>: (A, B).
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          title: (
            <>
              <strong>Triangular</strong>: (minimum, most likely, maximum).
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          title: (
            <>
              <strong>Normal</strong>: (most likely, standard deviation).
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          title: (
            <>
              <strong>Uniform</strong>: (minimum, maximum).
            </>
          ),
        }
      ],
    },
    { // STEP 4
      title: (
        <>
          For example, if the emergency manager for an EPZ took anywhere between 15 to 30 minutes to verify the hazard and initiate a public evacuation
          order, then the user would enter a warning issuance delay function with a uniform distribution (as in <FigReference figKey="figure-111" />).
        </>
      ),
      freeform: (
        <>
          <Figure

        </>
      ),
    },
    { // STEP 5
      title: (
        <>
          Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the new warning issuance delay and close the <em>Warning And Protective 
          Action Data Editor</em> (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />).
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Edit a Warning Issuance Delay

To edit an existing warning issuance delay, select the desired warning issuance delay name from the **Warning Issuance Delay** dropdown
menu (e.g., **Well Prepared** in <FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). From the **Warning Issuance Delay (Minutes)** panel, select
the desired uncertainty type from the **Uncertainty Type** dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />) and
define the amount of time (in minutes) it is estimated to take for the emergency managers to issue the warning to the public.

To view all of the default warning issuance delay curves, check the 
checkbox <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-checkbox.png" /> to **Display default Warning Issuance Delay Curves**; all
the default curves will display in the **Warning Issuance Delay** plot window (<FigReference figKey="delay-curves" />). Click **OK** to save the new warning issuance
delay and close the *Warning And Protective Action Data Editor*.

<Figure
  figKey="delay-curves"

  alt="Warning Issuance Delay – Default Warning Issuance Delay Curves"
  caption="Warning Issuance Delay – Default Warning Issuance Delay Curves"
/>

### First Alert Curves

From the *Warning And Protective Action Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />), select the **First Alert**
tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />). The first alert curves, alternatively known as warning diffusion (<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />),
represent the percentage of the population that receives a notification of the warning over time (e.g., fifty percent of the population will receive
a warning alert within forty minutes of warning issuance). First alert curves are entered for daytime (from the **Daytime First Alert**
tab) and night-time (from the **Night-time First Alert** tab) scenarios because the speed at which a first alert can be received can vary
significantly between daytime and night-time.

#### Daytime First Alert

The **Daytime First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-112" />) allows the user to set a unique (for multiple zones, when
present) warning system with uncertainty to define the diffusion curve. The diffusion curve represents the percentage of the population which will
receive a first alert warning over time during daytime hours from when the warning was issued and can be described with uncertainty (e.g.,
**Triangular** in <FigReference figKey="figure-112" />).

<Figure

  alt="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – First Alert Tab – Daytime First Alert"
  caption="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – First Alert Tab – Daytime First Alert"
/>

#### Night-time First Alert

The **Night-time First Alert** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />) allows the user to set a unique (for multiple zones, when 
present) warning system with uncertainty to define the diffusion curve. The diffusion curve represents the percentage of the population which will 
receive a first alert warning over time during night-time hours from when the warning was issued and can be described with uncertainty. 
The default curves take into account the challenges with sending out a warning at night (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />) compared to daytime.

#### Edit First Alert Diffusion Curves

Diffusion curves can be edited for both the daytime and night-time first alert curves or individually modified. To edit existing first alert
diffusion curves, select the desired diffusion curve set from the **First Alert Diffusion** dropdown menu (e.g., **Fast** in
<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />). Select the appropriate tab (**Daytime First Alert** tab or **Night-time First
Alert** tab), and either begin editing the values in the table or select the desired distribution from the **Distribution** dropdown menu and 
define the first alert diffusion curve. Click **OK** to save edits and close the *Warning And Protective Action Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />).

### Protective Action Initiation (PAI)

The **Protective Action Initiation** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />) allows the user to define new or edit existing
mobilization protective action initiation (PAI) delay diffusion curve with or without uncertainty. The PAI delay represents the percentage of the
population which will take protective action over time from when the first alert is received (<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />). During the PAI
delay, people are confirming the severity of the situation, packing, notifying others, protecting property, gathering family and pets, etc.

<Figure

  alt="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – Protective Action Initiation Tab"
  caption="Warning And Protective Action Data Editor – Protective Action Initiation Tab"
/>

LifeSim provides nine default PAI delay curves; the curves are categorized based on a combination of three emergency management agency preparedness
categories and three categories defining the public perception of the level of risk. 

**The emergency management agency preparedness categories are:**

- **Unknown**: This is an average condition between low and high and is
  assumed with the full range of uncertainty of both categories.

- **Low**: The emergency management agency is not well-prepared to
  issue an effective message to the public.

- **Moderate**: The emergency management agency is moderately well-prepared to
issue an effective message to the public that motivates the population receiving the message to act.

- **High**: The emergency management agency is well-prepared to issue
a well-crafted and convincing message to the public that motivates the population
receiving the message to act.

The public perception of the level of risk is generally a function of the individual or group’s distance from the hazard (e.g., dam or river). Other
factors that can influence public perception is the frequency and severity of recent events and extremely effective and persistent public awareness
campaigns.

**The public perception of the level of risk categories are:**

- **Unknown**: This is an average condition between low and high and is assumed with the full range of uncertainty of both categories.

- **Low**: The community at risk has a general perception
  that the warning and flood event will not affect them. When considering distance to the hazard
  location, this category could be used when the population is greater than 0.25
  miles from the river or greater than 0.5 miles from the dam.

- **Moderate**: The community at risk has a general perception
  that the warning and flood event could affect them. When considering distance to the hazard
  location, this category could be used when the population is approximately 0.25
  miles from the river or approximately 0.5 miles from the dam.

- **High**: The community at risk has a general perception
  that the warning and flood event will likely affect them. When considering distance to the hazard
  location, this category could be used when the population is less than 0.25 miles
  from the river or less than 0.5 miles from the dam.

#### Create New Protective Action Initiation

To create a new protective action initiation relationship:

<ProcessList
  items={[

        }
      ],
    },
    { // STEP 4
      title: (
        <>
          Define the daytime diffusion curve by entering the time (minutes) and percent initiated to take action in the <strong>PAI</strong> time-initiated
          table (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />). Diffusion curve values can be entered by hand or copied from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®)
          and pasted into the table (i.e., entire table, individual cells, columns, rows). From the <strong>PAI</strong> table, right-click to 
          open the shortcut menu (such as <FigReference figKey="first-alert-table" />). From the shortcut menu, the
          user can <strong>Add, Insert, and Delete Row(s)</strong>; <strong>Select All</strong>; <strong>Copy</strong> or <strong>Copy with 
          Headers</strong>; and <strong>Paste</strong>.
          <br/><br/>
          The PAI table can also be copied (with or without headers) into another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) for saving. 
          Use <strong>Ctrl + A</strong> (or the <strong>Select All</strong> command from the shortcut menu), right-click, and select <strong>Copy w/ 
          Headers</strong>. Then paste the data in the desired application to save. 
          <br/><br/>
          Errors in the PAI diffusion curve are highlighted in red in the table and a tooltip displays a message
          describing the error (as in <FigReference figKey="figure-95" />). Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut 
          menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) to sort the table in ascending or
          descending order, or clear the table sorting.

        Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the new PAI diffusion curve and close the <em>Warning And Protective 
        Action Data Editor</em> (<FigReference figKey="figure-113" />).
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Edit Protective Action Initiation

To edit an existing PAI diffusion curve, select the desired protective action delay relationship from the **Protective Action Delay**
dropdown menu (e.g., **Perception: Unknown / Preparedness: Unknown** in <FigReference figKey="figure-114" />). Either begin editing the values in
the PAI table or select the desired distribution from the **Distribution** dropdown menu and define the PAI diffusion curve. 
Click **OK** to save edits and close the *Warning
And Protective Action Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-114" />).

## Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) Editor

The *Emergency Planning Zone Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />) allows the user to import an emergency planning zones
(EPZ) dataset and enter information defining separate warning and evacuation parameters per EPZ. In most cases, separate emergency management agency
areas within the study area are modeled as unique emergency planning zones since the warning issuance efficiency, message content, and public response
can vary (<FigReference figKey="figure-106" />).

Users import the emergency planning zone dataset from a polygon shapefile where each polygon feature in the shapefile represents an emergency planning
zone. Multiple EPZ datasets can be imported and defined. The warning and evacuation parameters cannot be modified in the *Emergency Planning
Zone Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />); however, selecting the **Edit Data**
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" /> button opens the *Warning
And Protective Action Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />), which allows users to edit and define warning and protective action
parameters.

**NOTE:** the *Emergency Planning Zone Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />) opens when editing imported EPZ datasets (refer to [Edit an EPZ
Dataset](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#edit-an-epz-dataset)) but the *Import Emergency Planning Zone editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-119" />)
opens when importing a new EPZ dataset (refer to [Create and Define an EPZ
Dataset](./07-emergency-planning-data.mdx#create-and-define-an-epz-dataset)).

/>

### EPZ Editor Overview

The tabs on the *Emergency Planning Zone Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />) represent the warning delay and the first alert and PAI
diffusion curves that need to be created for the emergency planning zones. The *Emergency Planning Zone Editor*
contains four tabs: **Warning Issuance Delay**, **First Alert**, **Protective Action Initiation**, and **Issuance To Initiation**. The first three tabs contain
the same buttons for editing the warning and evacuation parameters. The **Edit 
Data** button <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" /> opens the *Warning And Protective Action 
Data Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />). All four tabs contain the same general plotting tools (located on the right side of the plot window) for
customizing the plots (review [Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for more
information).

### Create and Define an EPZ Dataset

In most cases, separate emergency management agency areas within the study area are modeled as unique emergency planning zones since the warning
issuance efficiency, message content, and public response can vary.

            protective action over time once the warning is issued. It also provides a way for the user to display the combined uncertainty of the warning and
            protective action functions. The combined function is a concise way to present the evacuation response to warning issuance.

          Once all of the correct information for the EPZ dataset has been entered (e.g., dataset <strong>Example_EPZ</strong> in <FigReference figKey="figure-124" />),
          click <strong>OK</strong>. The <em>Import Emergency Planning Zones</em> dialog box closes. From the
          LifeSim main window, from the <em>Study Tree</em>, under the <strong>Emergency Planning Zones</strong> folder,
          the name of the EPZ dataset will display (e.g., <strong>Example_EPZ</strong>).

### Edit an EPZ Dataset

Once an EPZ dataset has been created, the user can edit that EPZ dataset from the *Emergency Planning Zone Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />). From the 
LifeSim main window, from the **Study**
tab, from the *Study Tree*, from the **Emergency Planning Zones** folder, right-click on an EPZ dataset. From the shortcut
menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-125" />), click **Edit**. 

<Figure

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure125.png"
  alt="LifeSim Study Tree – Emergency Planning Zones Dataset – Shortcut Menu"
  caption="LifeSim Study Tree – Emergency Planning Zones Dataset – Shortcut Menu"
/>

Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the **Study** menu, point to **Emergency Planning Data**,
point to **Edit** (<FigReference figKey="figure-118" />), and click an EPZ dataset. 

Either way, the *Emergency Planning Zone Editor* (<FigReference figKey="figure-116" />) opens. Refer to section [EPZ Editor](#emergency-planning-zone-epz-editor)
for information on defining warning and evacuation parameters for a selected EPZ.

### Display an EPZ Dataset

To display an EPZ dataset, from the LifeSim main window, from the **Study** tab, from the *Study Tree*, from the **Emergency Planning Zones** folder, right-click
on an EPZ dataset. From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-125" />),
click **Show In Map Window**. The selected EPZ dataset will display in the map
window of the LifeSim main window.

Map layer attributes can be accessed for each map layer and is provided in a table for the dataset referenced by the map layer. The EPZ dataset must
be displayed in the map window before the attribute table can be accessed. To access a specific map layer's atribute table, from the **Map Layers** tab,
right-click on a map layer of interest. From the shortcut menu, click **Open Attribute Table** (<FigReference figKey="open-attribute-shortcut" />).

<Figure
  figKey="open-attribute-shortcut"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/open-attribute-shortcut.png"
  alt="LifeSim Main Window – Map Layers Tab – Open Attribute Table Shortcut Menu"
  caption="LifeSim Main Window – Map Layers Tab – Open Attribute Table Shortcut Menu"
/>

The *Map Layer Attributes* dialog box opens; review [Map
Layer Attributes Dialog Box](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#map-layer-attributes-dialog-box) for more information. Editing of the map layer
attributes is detailed in [Editing Map Layer Features and Attributes](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#editing-map-layer-features-and-attributes).

### Copy an EPZ Dataset

To copy an EPZ dataset from an existing dataset, from the LifeSim main window, from the **Study** tab, from the *Study Tree*, from 
the **Emergency Planning Zones** folder, right-click
on an EPZ dataset. From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-125" />),
click **Copy**. 

Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the **Study** menu, point to **Emergency Planning Data**,
point to **Copy** (<FigReference figKey="figure-118" />), and click an EPZ dataset.

Either way, the **Name of New Study Item** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />) opens. Enter a new name in the **Name** box. Click **OK**. The
*Name of New Study Item* dialog box closes and the copied
EPZ dataset will display in the *Study Tree* under the **Emergency Planning Zones** folder.

### Delete an EPZ Dataset

To delete an EPZ dataset from the LifeSim study and study directory files, from the LifeSim main window, from
the **Study** tab, from the *Study Tree*, from the **Emergency Planning Zones** folder, right-click on an EPZ
dataset. From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-125" />), click **Delete**. 

Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from
the **Study** menu, point to **Emergency Planning Data**, point to **Delete** (<FigReference figKey="figure-118" />), and click an EPZ dataset.

Either way, a *Confirm Delete* window (similar to <FigReference figKey="figure-87" />) opens asking for confirmation to delete the
selected EPZ dataset. Click **Yes**, the *Confirm Delete* message window closes, and the selected EPZ dataset is deleted from the 
study and no longer displays in the *Study Tree* under the **Emergency Planning Zones** folder.
