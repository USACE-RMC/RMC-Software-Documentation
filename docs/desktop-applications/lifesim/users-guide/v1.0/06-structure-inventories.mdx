# Structure Inventories

The next step after adding hydraulic data to the study is to add <strong>structure inventories</strong>. A structure inventory represents geospatial
points that contain damageable elements (typically a structure such as a home). Structure inventories are required and allow LifeSim to estimate
direct economic damage for a flood event. To estimate life loss for an event, a structure inventory must be supplied with population data.

<strong>Structure occupancy types</strong> provide a level of aggregation for structures in LifeSim, and are imperative for any consequence
calculation. The occupancy types describe depth-damage relationships, life loss parameters, general information about the structures, and contain
information about uncertainty computations associated with the structure inventory. Each structure is required to have an occupancy type.

LifeSim Version 2.0 can accept structure inventories in the form of point shapefiles and the National Structure Inventory database (NSI). This chapter
 describe the ways structure inventories in different formats can be added to, edited and displayed in an LifeSim study.

## Import from Shapefile

The point shapefile that represents a structure inventory for an area will contain information on structure occupancy types (Appendix C), population,
structure values, foundation height, construction type, and other information. The LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 4, provides
 the definitions for the attributes required for importing a structure inventory from a shapefile.

To create a structure inventory from a point shapefile:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Import Structures From Shapefile</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />). Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to
<strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, click <strong>Import Structures From Shapefile</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-69" />).

1. Either way, the <strong>Import From Point Shapefile</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />) will open.

1. In the <strong>Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />), enter a name for the structure inventory.

<Figure

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure68.png"
  alt="LifeSim Main Window – Study Tree – Structure Inventories Shortcut Menu"
  caption="LifeSim Main Window – Study Tree – Structure Inventories Shortcut Menu"
/>

<Figure
  figKey="figure-69"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure69.png"
  alt="LifeSim Main Window – Study Menu – Structure Inventories Sub-menu"
  caption="LifeSim Main Window – Study Menu – Structure Inventories Sub-menu"
/>

1. To select the shapefile that contains information about the structure inventory, to the right of the <strong>Structure Inventory Shapefile</strong>
 dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />), click . An <strong>Open</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-71" />) opens, navigate
 to the directory where the point shapefile is located. Select the correct point shapefile (e.g., <em>&#42;.shp</em>), click <strong>Open</strong>, the
<strong>Open</strong> browser will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-71" />) and the user will be returned to the <strong>Import From Point
Shapefile</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />). Alternatively, if the desired shapefile has already been imported as a map layer
 into the LifeSim study, then from the <strong>Structure Inventory Shapefile</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-72" />), select the
 desired map layer.

1. The <strong>Structure Inventory Shapefile</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />) will now contain the name and location of the
selected point shapefile.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-70"

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure71.png"
  alt="Open Browser"
  caption="Open Browser"
/>

1. A structure inventory has required attributes that will be used in an LifeSim study, so the user must provide information about those attributes in
 the selected point shapefile. From the <strong>Import Attributes</strong> column (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />), for each listed
<strong>Required Attribute</strong>, the user must select from a list the field name of the attribute in the selected point shapefile.

1. For example, in <FigReference figKey="figure-72" />, for <strong>Occupancy Type</strong> (required attribute), from the <strong>Import
Attributes</strong> list for <strong>Occupancy Type</strong>, possible field names are presented for the user. To set the <strong>Import</strong>
<strong>Attributes</strong>, use the dropdown menu to select the appropriate field name – e.g., <em>ST_DMGFUN</em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-72" />.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-72"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure72.png"
  alt="Define Structure Attribute Information – Occupancy Type"
  caption="Define Structure Attribute Information – Occupancy Type"
/>

1. Another example, in <FigReference figKey="figure-73" />, for <strong>Population Over 65 (Night)</strong> (required attribute), from the
<strong>Import Attributes</strong> list for <strong>Population Over 65 (Night)</strong>, possible field names are presented for the user. Use the
dropdown menu to select the appropriate field name – e.g., <em>POP_O65DAY</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-73" />.

1. If the point shapefile does not contain a required attribute, the user must click the <strong>Missing</strong> checkbox (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-73" />) for that required attribute (e.g., <em>Ground Floor Height</em>). In the <strong>Default Value</strong>
column (<FigReference figKey="figure-73" />) for that required attribute, the value box activates, and the user must enter a value for the required
attribute (e.g., <em>9</em>). The user defined default value will then be applied to all structures in the inventory.

1. Once all of the required structure attribute information has been completed, from the <strong>Import From Point Shapefile</strong> dialog box,
click <strong>Next</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-73" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-73"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure73.png"
  alt="Example – Define Structure Attribute Information – Population Over 65 (Night)"
  caption="Example – Define Structure Attribute Information – Population Over 65 (Night)"
/>

### Default Occupancy Type Assignments

Next the user must confirm the occupancy type names from the structure shapefile associated with the occupancy type IDs (Appendix C) that have been
defined in the study. Occupancy types are another level of aggregation for structures. Occupancy types are imperative for the consequence
calculations. Refer to [Occupancy Type Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#occupancy-type-editor) for more information on occupancy types.

1. From the point shapefile, LifeSim tries to match up the occupancy type names to the occupancy type IDs (<FigReference figKey="figure-74" />) that
exist in the model. For example, in <FigReference figKey="figure-74" />, for occupancy type ID <em><strong>RES3BI</strong></em>, LifeSim selected
<em><strong>RES3B </strong></em>from the existing occupancy types.

1. If the default selection is not correct, from the list the user can change the assignment from the <strong>Default</strong>
<strong>Assignment</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-74" />).

1. If the selected point shapefile does not contain a default occupancy type in the assigned field, then the dropdown menu will be empty. Users can
check for different occupancy type names from the <strong>Default</strong> <strong>Assignment</strong> dropdown menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-74" />); however, as the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-74" /> illustrates the selected
shapefile does not contain the <strong>RES1-3SNB</strong> occupancy type.

1. Once the user has reviewed the default occupancy type assignments, from the <strong>Import From Point Shapefile</strong> dialog box, click
<strong>Next</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-74" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-74"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure74.png"
  alt="Default Occupancy Type Assignments"
  caption="Default Occupancy Type Assignments"
/>

### Stability Criteria Assignments

Next the user must assign structure stability functions. Stability criteria are assigned to a structure based on rules that relate stability functions
 to identified attribute values. For example, if a rule states that all structures that are construction type ‘Wood’ should be assigned the
‘Wood-Framed Attached’ stability criteria. Then once Finish is clicked every structure that meets the criteria will be assigned the Wood-Framed
Attached stability function. These rules are not retained for future use. They are a one-time application to define the stability criteria that will
be used by structures. The assigned stability criteria can be viewed through the structure inventory attribute table ([View a Structure
Inventory](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#view-a-structure-inventory)). Refer to [Building Stability Curve
Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#building-stability-curve-editor) for further discussion on structure stability criteria.

LifeSim Version 2.0 has default rules that assign stability criteria for structures with specific construction and/or occupancy types. Alternatively,
the user may edit an existing default rule or create and define a new rule to assign stability criteria to structures based on any of the structure
attributes within the selected point shapefile. Note, the created rules are a 'rule stack' meaning the order in which the criteria are defined is important.
 If two rules apply to the same structure, then the higher (top) rule will dominate. Users should make certain all structures are covered by the
selected/created rules, for missed structures will not have a stability criteria assignment.

To assign default stability criteria:

1. LifeSim provides a list default rules for assigning stability criteria (<FigReference figKey="figure-75" />). For example, in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-75" />, the <strong>Rule List</strong> includes <em><strong>Steel Buildings Collapse Criteria</strong></em>. If a
default rule in the <strong>Rule List</strong> is not desired, then the user can remove the rule. Default rules can also be modified.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-75"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure75.png"
  alt="Default Construction Type Assignments"
  caption="Default Construction Type Assignments"
/>

1. Default or created rules can be deleted from the <strong>Rule List</strong>, by clicking the <strong>Delete</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-4f8f0e28.png" /> button next to the name of
undesired rule. Note: To add all default rules removed by accident, (this also removes all rules created by the user), click the
<strong>Previous</strong> button twice, to return to the first window in the import wizard (<strong>Define Structure Attribute Information</strong>
window), and then click the <strong>Next</strong> button twice, to return to the <strong>Stability Criteria Assignment</strong> window.

1. To view the conditions for any rules in the <strong>Rule List</strong>, select the desired rule (e.g., <em><strong>Manufactured Un-Attached
Structure Collapse Criteria</strong></em>) and view the rule conditions in the <strong>Rule Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-76" />).

1. Rules displayed in the <strong>Rule Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-76" />) can be modified. Click the <strong>Add</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ec51cdf7.png" /> button to add a new row to the
bottom of the rule stack. Click the <strong>Delete</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-4f8f0e28.png" /> button to remove a row. To move a
 row in the rule stack, click and hold the <strong>Move</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-fd1576a9.png" /> button and drag the row to the
desired location and drop the row.

1. The first list in the row is populated by the Import Attributes in the selected shapefile (e.g., <em>ST_DMGFUN</em>). The second list contains the
appropriate comparison operators (e.g., <em>Equals</em>, <em>Not Equal</em>, <em>Greater Than</em>, <em>Less Than</em>, <em>Contains</em>) for the
selected Import Attribute. The final list in the row is populated with the selected import attribute fields (e.g., <em>RES2</em>).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-76"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure76.png"
  alt="Import From Point Shapefile – Example Default Rule – Rule Editor"
  caption="Import From Point Shapefile – Example Default Rule – Rule Editor"
/>

To create and define a new rule:

1. For new rules, click the <strong>Create Rule</strong> button. The <strong>Rule Editor</strong> will populate with the base rule stack (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-77" />). Enter a name for the new rule in the <strong>Rule Name</strong> box.

1. In the top row, from the list, select whether the rule is applied if <strong>Any</strong> or <strong>All</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-77" />) of the criteria are satisfied. From the list, from the top row, select a construction type from the default
 list (e.g., <em>RESCDAM – Wood Unanchored</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-77" />).

1. Complete the rule definition by adding and defining new conditions for the rule stack. For each row added selected the Import Attribute (e.g.,
<em>ID_CONSTRU</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-77" />), the comparison operator (e.g., <em>Contains</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-77" />
), and the condition to search for based on the selected Import Attribute (e.g., <em>Wood</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-77" />).

<Figure

  alt="Import From Point Shapefile – Create New Rule – Rule Editor Example"
  caption="Import From Point Shapefile – Create New Rule – Rule Editor Example"
/>

1. Once the user has the desired stability criteria assignments rules in the <strong>Rule List</strong>, from the <strong>Import From Point
Shapefile</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Finish</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-77" />).

1. The <strong>Import From Point Shapefile</strong> dialog box will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-77" />). From the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, under the <strong>Structure
Inventories</strong> folder, the name of the imported <strong>Structure Inventory</strong> data set is listed.

## Import from National Structure Inventory (NSI)

The National Structure Inventory (NSI) for an area, will contain information on structure occupancy types, population, structure values, foundation
height, build type, and other information. The NSI is currently only available to U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) users. The NSI is a database of
structure locations and attributes and was developed using information from the HAZUS database and other sources including the Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics database (). To create a structure inventory from the NSI:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />). Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to
<strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, click <strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong>. Either way, the <strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong>
 dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-78" />) opens.

1. In the <strong>Structure Inventory Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-78" />), enter a name for the structure inventory.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-78"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure78.png"
  alt="Import Structures From NSI Dialog Box"
  caption="Import Structures From NSI Dialog Box"
/>

1. To select the bounding polygon shapefile that defines the boundaries of the structure inventory, to the right of the <strong>Bounding Polygon
Shapefile</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-78" />), click . An <strong>Open</strong> browser will open (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-71" />), navigate to the directory where the bounding polygon shapefile is located. The bounding polygon shapefile
must have a projection in order to properly access the NSI database. Select the correct bounding polygon shapefile (e.g., <em>&#42;.shp</em>), click
<strong>Open</strong>, the <strong>Open</strong> browser will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-71" />), and the user will be returned to the
<strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-78" />). Alternatively, if the desired shapefile has already
been imported as a map layer into the LifeSim study, then from the <strong>Bounding Polygon Shapefile</strong> dropdown menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-140" />), select the desired map layer.

1. In the <strong>Bounding Polygon Buffer</strong> (units set by the <strong>Bounding Polygon Shapefile</strong> selection) box, enter a buffer
distance for the bounding polygon shapefile (optional). The default value is zero.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong> dialog box will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-78" />). The
LifeSim <strong>Status Bar</strong> will display the progress for the NSI structures download.

1. Once the download is complete the <strong>Status Bar</strong> will display the message, "Structure Inventory successfully imported from NSI". From
the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, under the
<strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, the name of the imported <strong>Structure Inventory</strong> dataset is listed.

## View and Edit a Structure Inventory

An imported structure inventory can be copied or deleted, viewed in the map window, appended with new structures, population information can be imported,
 and new stability criteria rules can be created. [View and Edit a Structure
Inventory](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#view-and-edit-a-structure-inventory) provides detailed instructions for viewing and editing the structure
inventory.

To access the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong> shortcut commands and edit an imported structure inventory, from the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Structure
Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory. The structure inventory shortcut menu opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />).
 Commands include show in (or remove from) map window, tools, move up, move down, copy, and delete. The <strong>Tools</strong> shortcut submenu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />) contain commands for appending the structure inventory, importing population, and adding stability
assignment criteria rules.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-79"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure79.png"
  alt="LifeSim Study Tree – Imported Structure Inventory Shortcut Commands"
  caption="LifeSim Study Tree – Imported Structure Inventory Shortcut Commands"
/>

When a structure inventory is imported, default criteria for damage, stability, and submergence are assigned to structures based on the occupancy type
 attribute information and the stability criteria rules. The criteria for structure damage, stability, and submergence can be edited, created, and
assigned. [Occupancy Type Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#occupancy-type-editor) and [Building Stability Curve
Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#building-stability-curve-editor) describe how to edit the occupancy types and structure inventory criteria,
respectfully.

Editing individual structures or attributes of the imported structure inventory map layer can be accomplished from the Map Layers Tab; review
[Appendix B](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#appendix-b-map-preferences) for information regarding editing the structure inventory map layer.

### View a Structure Inventory

Users can view the structure inventory in the map window and can view the structure inventory attributes.

#### Show in Map Window

From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from
the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory. From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />
), click <strong>Show In Map Window</strong>. The selected structure inventory will display in the map window of the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-80" />). Note, right-click a displayed structure inventory and click <strong>Remove</strong> <strong>From</strong>
<strong>Map</strong> <strong>Window</strong>, from the shortcut menu to stop displaying the structure inventory.

<Figure

  caption="Example -- LifeSim Main Window – Structure Inventory Displayed in Map Window"
/>

#### View Attributes Table

Map layer attributes can be accessed for each map layer and is provided in a table for the dataset referenced by the map layer. The structure
inventory dataset must be displayed in the map window before the attribute table can be accessed. To access a specific map layer Attribute table, from
 the Map Layers tab, right-click on a map layer of interest, from the shortcut menu, click Open Attribute Table. The Map Layer Attributes dialog box
opens; review [Map Layer Attributes Dialog Box](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#map-layer-attributes-dialog-box) for more information. Editing of
the map layer attributes is detailed in [Editing Map Layer Features and
Attributes](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#editing-map-layer-features-and-attributes).

### Append Structures

Structures can be appended to from a point shapefile or from NSI.

#### Append from a Shapefile

To append the structure inventory from a shapefile, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the
<strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure
inventory (e.g., <em>Ex_StructureInventory</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-79" />). From the structure inventory shortcut menu, point to
<strong>Tools</strong> and select <strong>Append</strong> <strong>Structures</strong> <strong>From</strong> <strong>Shapefile</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />) submenu command. The <strong>Append</strong> <strong>From</strong> <strong>Point</strong>
<strong>Shapefile</strong> dialog box opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-81" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-81"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure81.png"
  alt="Example – Append From Point Shapefile Dialog Box"
  caption="Example – Append From Point Shapefile Dialog Box"
/>

Alternatively, to open the <strong>Append</strong> <strong>From</strong> <strong>Point</strong> <strong>Shapefile</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-81" />) from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, point to
<strong>Append From Shapefile</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-69" />) and select the structure inventory.

Select the appropriate shapefile, define the structure attribute information, the default occupancy type assignments, and the stability criteria
assignment for the point shapefile. Except for adding a name, the Append From Point Shapefile dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-81" />)
requires the same steps as the Import From Point Shapefile dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />); refer to [Import from
Shapefile](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#import-from-shapefile) for detailed instructions on completing the Import From Point Shapefile dialog box.

#### Append from NSI

Alternatively, append structures from NSI. To append the structure inventory from NSI, from the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Structure
Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory. From the structure inventory shortcut menu, point to <strong>Tools</strong> and
select <strong>Append</strong> <strong>Structures</strong> <strong>From</strong> <strong>NSI</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />) submenu
command. Alternatively, to open the <strong>Append</strong> <strong>From</strong> <strong>NSI</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-81" />
) from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, point to <strong>Append From NSI</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-69" />) and select the structure inventory.

Either way, the <strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-82" />) opens. Except for adding a name, the
<strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-81" />) for appending structures requires the same steps as the
<strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-78" />); refer to [Import from
NSI](#import-from-national-structure-inventory-nsi) for detailed instructions on completing the <strong>Import Structures From NSI</strong> dialog
box.

  alt="Import Structures From NSI – Appending a Structure Inventory"
  caption="Import Structures From NSI – Appending a Structure Inventory"
/>

### Import Population

Users can import population information for a structure inventory from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database (). To append the
structure inventory from NSI, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the
<strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory (e.g.,
<em>Ex_StructureInventory</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-79" />). From the structure inventory shortcut menu, point to <strong>Tools</strong>
and select <strong>Import Population From LEHD</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />) submenu command. The <strong>Import Population From
LEHD</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-83" />) opens.

The <strong>Import Population From LEHD</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-83" />) contains a table providing two editable columns,
<strong>Day</strong> and <strong>Night</strong> <strong>Households</strong>, for users to define the household size for each occupancy type. The
entered household size is used to distribute the imported population. Note: all household values must be greater than zero. Cells containing a value
of zero are highlighted in red (<FigReference figKey="figure-83" />). Shortcut menu commands provide users with the ability to add, insert and delete
 row(s); select all; copy, copy with headers and paste (<FigReference figKey="figure-83" />). Open the shortcut menu by highlighting and
right-clicking the row(s) of interest.

<Figure

  alt="Import Population From LEHD Dialog Box – Shortcut Menu – Example with Errors"
  caption="Import Population From LEHD Dialog Box – Shortcut Menu – Example with Errors"
/>

Once the day and night household cells contain the correct household size, click <strong>OK</strong> to import the population. <strong>Note:</strong>
An <strong>LifeSim</strong> error message opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-84" />) when cells do not contain values greater than zero and the
<strong>OK</strong> button is clicked.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-84"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure84.png"
  alt="LifeSim Error Message"
  caption="LifeSim Error Message"
/>

Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the <strong>LifeSim</strong> error message (<FigReference figKey="figure-84" />) and return to the <strong>Import
Population From LEHD</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-83" />). Fix the cell(s) with zero values and click <strong>OK</strong> to import
 the population.

### Assign Stability Criteria

Stability criteria can be assigned to a structure based on rules that relate stability functions to identified attribute values of the structure. The
stability criteria assignment tool will take the rules that are defined and use them to assign the selected stability criteria to each structure that
meets the rules. For example, if a rule states that all structures that are construction type ‘Wood’ should be assigned the ‘Wood-Framed Attached’
stability criteria. Then once OK is clicked every structure that meets the criteria will be assigned the Wood-Framed Attached stability function.
These rules are not retained for future use. They are a one-time application to define the stability criteria that will be used by structures. The
assigned stability criteria can be viewed through the structure inventory attribute table ([View a Structure
Inventory](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#view-a-structure-inventory)). Refer to [Building Stability Curve
Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#building-stability-curve-editor) for further discussion on structure stability criteria.

Users can create structure inventory specific stability criteria assignment rules from the <strong>Stability</strong> <strong>Criteria Assignment
Tool</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />). To open the dialog box, from the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong>
right-click the structure inventory name (e.g., <em>Ex_StructureInventory</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-79" />), from the shortcut menu point
to <strong>Tools</strong> and select <strong>Assign Stability Criteria</strong>. The <strong>Stability</strong> <strong>Criteria Assignment
Tool</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />) opens.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-85"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure85.png"
  alt="Stability Criteria Assignment Tool Dialog Box"
  caption="Stability Criteria Assignment Tool Dialog Box"
/>

LifeSim Version 2.0 has default rules that assign stability criteria for structures with specific construction and/or occupancy types. To load the
default rules, click the <strong>Load Defaults</strong> button. Alternatively, the user may edit an existing default rule or create and define a new
rule based on any of the structure attributes within the selected structure inventory. Note, the created rules are a 'rule stack' meaning the order in
 which the criteria are defined is important. If two rules apply to the same structure, then the higher (top) rule will dominate. Users should make
certain all structures are covered by the selected/created rules, for missed structures will not have a stability criteria assignment.

The Import From Point Shapefile dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-75" />) requires the same steps as the Stability Criteria Assignment Tool
dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />); refer to [Stability Criteria
Assignments](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#stability-criteria-assignments) for detailed instructions on completing the Stability Criteria Assignment
Tool dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />).

Click <strong>Yes</strong>, the <strong>Confirm Delete</strong> message window will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-87" />), and the selected
structure inventory is deleted, and no longer displays in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> under the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder.

## Occupancy Type Editor

Each structure is required to have an <strong>occupancy type</strong>. Occupancy types are a subcategory of the default <strong>damage
categories</strong> assigned to a study and describe a class of structures (e.g., RES1-1SNB which is a single family residential structure that is one
 story tall with no basement). <strong>Damage categories</strong> represent a high level grouping for structures. They are used in the Economic
Consequence Assessment Model (ECAM) process to determine population and capital impacted for each event. In other words, damage categories represent a
 grouping of occupancy types. By default, a LifeSim study is pre-loaded with default damage categories and occupancy types. Default damage categories
are residential, commercial, industrial, and public. Default occupancy types follow the naming convention developed for HAZUS (FEMA 2019) and are
listed in the LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Appendix D.

Users can modify default occupancy types or create and define new occupancy types with unique depth-damage functions and uncertainty parameters.
However, entered data is applied to all the structures assigned to a created or modified occupancy type. Several occupancy types can be assigned to a
single damage category. For example, single-story structures with no basements, single-story structures with basements, mobile homes, and duplex
apartments are different structure occupancy types assigned to a residential damage category. Structure inventories imported from NSI will
automatically have the LifeSim default occupancy types defined as attributes. Structures imported from point shapefiles require users to match the
shapefiles occupancy types with the LifeSim preloaded default occupancy type assignment (review [Default Occupancy Type
Assignments](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#default-occupancy-type-assignments)).

Data describing an occupancy type include: the depth-percent damage functions (structure, content, vehicle and other); the evacuation parameters;
submergence criteria; and the uncertainties in the first foundation height offset, submergence criteria, variation in values (structure, content
vehicle and other) as a percent; and the damage in the depth-damage functions.

The <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) allows the user to revise and create the evacuation parameters,
submergence criteria, economic damage depth-damage functions, value uncertainty, and foundation height uncertainty associated with structures that
share common attributes (and therefore grouped by damage category). Also, from the editor, a user can assign damage criteria based on any combination
of structure damage category, occupancy class, number of stories, basement information and construction type.

### Occupancy Type Editor Structure

To open the <strong>Occupancy</strong> <strong>Type</strong> <strong>Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />), from the LifeSim main
window (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-69" />), and click <strong>Edit Occupancy Types</strong>. Alternatively, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
under <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> right-click on <strong>Occupancy Types</strong> and from the shortcut menu click <strong>Edit Occupancy
Types</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-89" />). Either way, the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />)
opens.

clicking on the expanded header collapses the group or vice versa collapses an expanded group.

#### Occupancy Type Data

From the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />), the right side of the editor contains the data entered for the
 selected occupancy type (e.g., <em>RES1-1SNB</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-88" />). Directly below the <strong>Occupancy Type Name</strong>
field is the <strong>Description</strong> field; both fields can be edited. Modify or set the damage category for selected occupancy type using the
<strong>Damage</strong> <strong>Category</strong> dropdown menu; the menu contains the list of default damage categories (and any user added damage
categories). Edit or set the uncertainty in the foundation height offset, from the <strong>Foundation Height Offset</strong> panel. Add or edit the
structure, content, vehicle, and other depth-damage functions from the set of tabs located within the <strong>Economic</strong>
<strong>Damage</strong> tab; set the warning and protective action behavior from the <strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab; and
set the uncertainty in the high hazard heights from the <strong>Submergence</strong> <strong>Criteria</strong> tab. Review the next section to learn
how to create and define a new occupancy type in the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />).

### Create or Edit an Occupancy Type

The following sections describe how to create a new occupancy type and define the individual components of the occupancy type. Note, skip the
instructions for creating a new occupancy type and start from the damage category assignment section to learn how to editing an existing or copied
occupancy type.

#### Create New Occupancy Type

To create a new occupancy type:

1. From the LifeSim main window’s <strong>Study</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, right-click
 on <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Edit Occupancy Types</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-89" />).
 Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-69" />), click <strong>Edit Occupancy Types</strong>. Either way the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) opens.

1. From the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />), click the <strong>Create New Occupancy Type</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-298be86c.png" /> button. The <strong>Name of New
Occupancy Type</strong> dialog box opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-91" />).

1. Enter a unique name (required) in the <strong>Name</strong> box and click <strong>OK</strong>. The <strong>Name of New Occupancy Type</strong>
dialog box closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-91" />), and the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) will
create and display the new undefined occupancy type.

#### Assign the Damage Category

1. By default, newly created occupancy types are added alphabetically to the occupancy type list for the damage category selected at the time that the
 new occupancy type was created. For example, if the user has <strong>AGR1</strong> occupancy type name selected (in the <strong>Occupancy</strong>
<strong>Type</strong> <strong>Tree</strong>) and creates the new occupancy type, then the new occupancy type will automatically be added to the
<strong>Commercial</strong> damage category (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />). Select the appropriate damage category, from the
<strong>Damage</strong> <strong>Category</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />).
Alternatively, create an new damage category by clicking the <strong>Add New Damage Category</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-99d01699.png" /> button to open the <strong>Name
of New Damage Category</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-90" />). Enter the name for the new damage category in the
<strong>Name</strong> field and click <strong>OK</strong> to create the new damage category. Note, existing and created damage categories cannot be
renamed, copied, or deleted.

#### Enter the Foundation Height Offset

1. The user can set or modify the uncertainty around the foundation height using the Foundation Height Offset. The user needs to define the
uncertainty about foundation heights at the occupancy type level using the structure's foundation height attribute as the most likely or mean
estimate. For example, if all RES1-1SNB occupancy type structures have uncertainty about foundation height of 1’ then the Foundation Height Offset
could be set to a uniform distribution of minimum -1’ and maximum of 1’. The default uncertainty is <strong>None</strong>, from the
<strong>Uncertainty Type</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-93" />), the user can chose <strong>Triangular</strong>,
<strong>Normal</strong> (standard deviation), and <strong>Uniform</strong> (minimum, maximum). For the example provided in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-93" />, <strong>Triangular</strong> has been selected; therefore, the <strong>Minimum</strong> and
<strong>Maximum</strong> values need to be entered.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-93"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure93.png"
  alt="Foundation Height Offset Uncertainty – Triangular Example"
  caption="Foundation Height Offset Uncertainty – Triangular Example"
/>

#### Enter the Economic Depth-Damage Functions

The <strong>Economic</strong> <strong>Damage</strong> tab holds the <strong>Structure</strong> <strong>Damage</strong>, <strong>Content</strong>
<strong>Damage</strong>, <strong>Vehicle</strong> <strong>Damage</strong> and <strong>Other</strong> <strong>Damage</strong> sub-tabs (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />). Each sub-tab provides the same configuration for entering and defining the depth-damage functions.
Therefore, the following instructions, although written from the perspective of the <strong>Structure</strong> <strong>Damage</strong> sub-tab, can be
 used to complete any of the depth-percent damage functions (structure, content, vehicle and other).

To enter the structure damage depth-damage function:

1. Enable the <strong>Structure</strong> <strong>Damage</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />) sub-tab by checking the  checkbox for the tab.

1. The user can set the <strong>Variation in Structure Value as %</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />) by defining the uncertainty about
the structure value associated with a structure based on the selected occupancy type. From the <strong>Uncertainty Type</strong> dropdown menu, the
default selection is <strong>None</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />). The uncertainty types available are the <strong>Triangular</strong>
 (minimum, maximum), <strong>Normal</strong> (standard deviation), and <strong>Uniform</strong> (minimum, maximum).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-94"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure94.png"
  alt="Occupancy Type Editor – Economic Damage Tab – New Occupancy Type"
  caption="Occupancy Type Editor – Economic Damage Tab – New Occupancy Type"
/>

1. The user can also set the uncertainty associated with how much damage can occur from depths of water at the structure for the <strong>Structure
Depth-Damage Function</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />). By default, the uncertainty in the structure depth-damage function is
<strong>None</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />). Uncertainty types available are the <strong>Triangular</strong> (minimum, maximum),
<strong>Normal</strong> (standard deviation), and <strong>Uniform</strong> (minimum, maximum).

1. Depth-damage function values can be entered into the <strong>Depth-Damage Function Table</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />) by hand,
copied from another occupancy type or from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) and pasted into the table (i.e., entire table, individual
cells, columns, rows). From the <strong>Depth-Damage Function Table</strong>, right-click to open the shortcut menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />), from the shortcut menu the user can add, insert, and delete row(s); select all; copy or copy with headers;
 and paste.
For example, from another occupancy type select a cell in the table and use <strong>Ctrl + A</strong> (or right-click and select the
<strong>Select</strong> <strong>All</strong> command from the shortcut menu), to select the entire table. Use <strong>Ctrl + C</strong> (or the
<strong>Copy</strong> shortcut menu command) to copy the data to the clipboard. Return to the newly created occupancy type and select the first cell
in the first row and use <strong>Ctrl + V</strong> to paste all the copied data.
The depth-damage function table can also be copied (with or without headers) into another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) for saving. Use
<strong>Ctrl + A</strong> (or the <strong>Select</strong> <strong>All</strong> command from the shortcut menu), right-click and select <strong>Copy w/
 Headers</strong>. Then paste the data in the desired application to save.

1. Errors in the depth-damage function are highlighted in red and a tooltip displays a message describing the error (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />). Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) to sort the
table in ascending or descending order or clear the table sorting.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-95"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure95.png"
  alt="Example – Occupancy Type Editor – Depth-Damage Function"
  caption="Example – Occupancy Type Editor – Depth-Damage Function"
/>

1. The Structural Depth-Damage Function plot (<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) provides a live update for the data entered in the table. Review
[Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting
 tools (located on the right side of the plot window) and for customizing plots.

1. Complete the economic depth-damage functions by repeating the above steps to enter the content, vehicle, and other depth-damage functions from the
<strong>Content</strong> <strong>Damage</strong>, <strong>Vehicle</strong> <strong>Damage</strong> and <strong>Other</strong> <strong>Damage</strong>
sub-tabs (<FigReference figKey="figure-94" />), respectfully.

#### Set the Evacuation Parameters

After completing the economic depth-damage functions for the new occupancy type, select the <strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong>
tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />). This tab contains evacuation parameters set for all structures assigned to the selected occupancy type.
Review the LifeSim Technical Reference Manual for more information regarding the evacuation parameters defined by the structure occupancy type.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-96"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure96.png"
  alt="Occupancy Type Editor – Evacuation Parameters Tab"
  caption="Occupancy Type Editor – Evacuation Parameters Tab"
/>

1. From the <strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />), define the following evacuation
parameters for the new occupancy type:

  - The user can set warning and protective action behavior for the selected occupancy type. If the <strong>Population in structure warned at the same
 time</strong> checkbox is selected (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) then the warning will reach all people in the structure at once instead of
at different times. For example, in an apartment building, residents could receive a warning at different times but for a single family residential
structure the warning will reach all people in the structure at the same time.

  - The user can also select <strong>Population in structure takes protective action at the same time</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />),
 this is where all of the people within the structure will try to evacuate at the same time. For example, in a single-family residential structure
everyone will try to evacuate at the same time but in a commercial structure everyone might try to evacuate at different times.

  - Enter the probability that the population of the structure can access the roof or attic of the structure in the <strong>Probability of access to
roof/attic (omitting limited mobility)</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) field. By default, the probability is set to
<em><strong>0.9</strong></em>, and the range of possible probabilities is 0.0 to 1.0.

  - In the <strong>Fraction to roof vs attic (if access if possible)</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) field, set the fraction of the
population of the structure that can access the roof. By default, the fraction for roof vs. attic is <em><strong>1</strong></em>; enter a value
between 0.0 and 1.0.

  - For the <strong>Fraction of population that evacuate in vehicles vs on foot</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) field, enter the
fraction of the structure’s population that evacuate in vehicles vs. on foot. By default, the fraction for vehicle vs. on foot is
<em><strong>1</strong></em>; enter a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

  - By default, the <strong>Evacuating Group Size (e.g., number of people per evacuating vehicle)</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />)
field is <em><strong>3</strong></em>. Enter the appropriate group size for the created occupancy type. For example, RES5 (institutional dormitories)
has a set group size of 48 to simulate evacuation by bus.

#### Enter the Submergence Criteria

<strong>Submergence</strong> is defined as a water level at a structure that can affect probability of survival. The <strong>submergence
criteria</strong> in LifeSim Version 2.0 is used to define the threshold between high hazard and low hazard conditions when people are trapped in a
flooded structure.

Note, in LifeSim Version 1.0, submergence criteria were divided into three zones: chance, compromised and safe. However, in LifeSim Version 2.0, the
original three zones were replaced with two new zones: low and high hazard. The LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 9, Section
9.2, provides a detailed explanation regarding the development of the two new zones. LifeSim Version 2.0 characterizes the high hazard or low hazard
conditions as described below:

- <strong>High Hazard Zone: </strong>Refers to those conditions where the stability criteria or submergence criteria of the person, the vehicle (if
caught while evacuating), or the structure (if not mobilized) has been exceeded. When the stability (or submergence) criteria has been exceeded
survival depends largely on chance.

- <strong>Low Hazard Zone: </strong>Refers to those conditions where the person or group of people are exposed to relatively calm floodwaters, where
the stability of the individual, group, or shelter is not at risk. A hazard exists due to the potential for bad things to happen when people come in
contact with water in locations not meant for such an interaction.

The threshold of submergence is an uncertain parameter sampled uniquely for each structure. Review the LifeSim Technical Reference Manual for more
information regarding the submergence criteria. To enter the submergence criteria for the High Hazard zone for the new occupancy type:

1. Select the <strong>Submergence Criteria</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-97" />) and set the uncertainty in the threshold of submergence
 from the <strong>Uncertainty Type</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-97" />), the user can chose <strong>Triangular</strong>,
<strong>Normal</strong> (standard deviation), and <strong>Uniform</strong> (minimum, maximum); or select <strong>None</strong> for no uncertainty. For
 the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-97" />, <strong>Triangular</strong> has been selected for all three criteria; therefore, the
<strong>Minimum</strong>, <strong>Most</strong> <strong>Likely</strong> and <strong>Maximum</strong> values need to be entered.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-97"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure97.png"
  alt="Occupancy Type Editor – Submergence Criteria Tab – Default Values"
  caption="Occupancy Type Editor – Submergence Criteria Tab – Default Values"
/>

1. Users set the threshold values for the three potential high hazard zones. If the depth of flooding is above the defined high hazard zone, then
people caught in the structure will be placed in the high hazard zone. The three submergence criteria are:

  - <strong>High Hazard Depth On Roof (ft)</strong> – users set the threshold for this high hazard zone with or without uncertainty by entering depth
(ft) as measured from the roof up. For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-97" />, the most likely value (or best estimate) is 4 ft
above the roof, with a minimum of 2 ft and maximum of 5 ft above the roof. In this case if the depth of flooding is above the <strong>High Hazard
Depth On Roof</strong> submergence criteria, then able-bodied people caught on the roof will be placed in the high hazard zone.

  - <strong>High Hazard Depth From Ceiling (ft)</strong> – users set the threshold for this high hazard zone with or without uncertainty by entering
depth (ft) as measured from the top of the ceiling (of the top floor of the building). For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-97" />
, the most likely value (or best estimate) is 1 ft below the ceiling, with a minimum of 0.5 ft and maximum of 1.5 ft below the ceiling. In this case
if the depth of flooding is above the <strong>High Hazard Depth From Ceiling</strong> submergence criteria, then able-bodied people caught in the
structure will be placed in the high hazard zone.

  - <strong>High Hazard Depth From Floor (ft)</strong> – users set the threshold for this high hazard zone with or without uncertainty by entering
depth (ft) as measured from floor towards the ceiling (of the top floor of the building). For the example provided in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-97" />, the most likely value (or best estimate) is 5 ft above the floor, with a minimum of 4 ft and maximum of 6
ft above the floor. In this case if the depth of flooding is above the <strong>High Hazard Depth From Floor</strong> submergence criteria, then
limited mobility occupants caught in the structure will be placed in the high hazard zone.

1. Once information about the selected occupancy type is entered, from the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />
), click <strong>OK</strong>. The <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> will close and the information for the new (or edited) occupancy type is
saved.

### Delete an Occupancy Type

From the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) select an occupancy type from the <strong>Occupancy Type
Name</strong> list. Click the <strong>Delete</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ff03d1c8.png" /> button and a
<strong>Confirm</strong> <strong>Delete</strong> window opens asking for confirmation to delete the selected item. Click <strong>Yes</strong>, the
<strong>Confirm</strong> <strong>Delete</strong> message window closes and the selected stability criteria is deleted.

### Copy an Occupancy Type

From the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) select an occupancy type from the <strong>Name</strong> list.
Click <strong>Copy</strong> <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-251c2a2b.png" />, the
<strong>Save Occupancy Type As</strong> dialog will open (<FigReference figKey="figure-92" />). Enter a new name in the <strong>Name</strong> box.
Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Save Occupancy Type As</strong> dialog box will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-92" />). Users will return
 to the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) with the new occupancy type displayed.

## Building Stability Curve Editor

<strong>Stability criteria</strong> defines the depth and velocity threshold for total structure collapse due to a hazard. The threshold is defined by
 a depth – velocity curve. If at any time during a simulation the depth and velocity are at a point above the velocity curve then the structure is
assumed to be collapsed which can have significant impacts on estimated life loss. The building stability criteria is generally based on the construction
 type. The user can add, edit, and assign stability criteria based on the structure attributes: construction type, number of stories, occupancy type.
The <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) allows the user to define stability criteria for the
structure inventory.

### Building Stability Curve Editor Overview

Similar to the Occupancy Type Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />), the Building Stability Curve Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />
) contains a tree on the left side to allow users to select a building stability criteria from the list of defaults. Selected stability criteria data
includes a Structural Stability Threshold plot and is displayed on the right side of the editor. The Structural Stability Threshold plot has a
toolbar; review [Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the
general plotting tools (located on the right side of the plot window) and for customizing plots. The Building Stability Curve Editor (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) has buttons for creating, deleting and copying a selected stability criteria. The following sections
describes the Building Stability Curve Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) in more detail.

### Create or Edit a Building Stability Criteria

To create a new stability criteria:

1. To open the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />), from the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, under <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> right-click on
<strong>Building Stability Criteria</strong> and from the shortcut menu click <strong>Building Stability Criteria Data</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-103" />). The <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) opens.

1. From the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />), click the <strong>Add New</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-99d01699.png" /> button. The <strong>Name of New
Stability Criteria Threshold</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-100" />) opens.

1. Enter a name (required) in the <strong>Name</strong> box for the new stability criteria. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Name of New
Stability Criteria Threshold</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-100" />) closes. The <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong>
(<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />) displays the new blank stability criteria.

An existing stability criteria can be edited or a newly created criteria can be defined following the remaining instructions in this section.

1. Enter a description (optional but recommended) in the <strong>Description</strong> field (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />).

1. Next, enter the structural stability threshold curve in the table on the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-102" />). If adding uncertainty for the depth (ft) parameter, uncheck the  checkbox to disable the <strong>Velocity
 Uncertain Parameter</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />), by default the checkbox is unchecked.
Alternatively, add uncertainty for the velocity parameter, check the  checkbox to enable the <strong>Velocity Uncertain Parameter</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-105" />). Note, Depth (ft) is now the x-variable and Velocity (ft/s) is now the y-variable.

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure105.png"
  alt="Velocity Uncertain Parameter Enabled"
  caption="Velocity Uncertain Parameter Enabled"
/>

1. From the <strong>Distribution Type</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />), select the desired distribution type for the
y-variable. By default, <strong>Deterministic</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-105" />) is selected. The distribution types available are:

  - <strong>Normal</strong> – mean (μ), standard deviation (σ).

  - <strong>Truncated Normal</strong> – mean (μ), standard deviation (σ), minimum, maximum.

  - <strong>Log-Normal</strong> – mean (of log, μ), standard deviation (of log, σ).

  - <strong>Triangular</strong> – minimum (a), most likely (c), maximum (b).

  - <strong>Uniform</strong> – minimum, maximum.

1. The threshold depth – velocity curve can be entered into the Structural Stability Threshold Table (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />) by hand,
copied from another stability criteria or from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) and pasted into the table (i.e., entire table, individual
cells, columns, rows). From the Structural Stability Threshold Table, right-click to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />), from
 the shortcut menu the user can add, insert, and delete row(s); select all; copy or copy with headers; and paste.
For example, from another stability criteria select a cell in the table and use Ctrl + A (or right-click and select the Select All command from the
shortcut menu), to select the entire table. Use Ctrl + C (or the Copy shortcut menu command) to copy the data to the clipboard. Return to the newly
created stability criteria and select the first cell in the first row and use Ctrl + V to paste all the copied data.
The stability threshold table can also be copied (with or without headers) into another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) for saving. Use Ctrl + A
(or the Select All command from the shortcut menu), right-click and select Copy w/ Headers. Then paste the data in the desired application to save.
Errors in the stability threshold table are highlighted in red and a tooltip displays a message describing the error (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />). Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) to sort the
table in ascending or descending order, or clear the table sorting.
The Structural Stability Threshold plot (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) provides a live update for the data entered in the table. Review
[Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting
 tools (located on the right side of the plot window) and for customizing plots.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) closes and saves all edits
to building stability curves.
