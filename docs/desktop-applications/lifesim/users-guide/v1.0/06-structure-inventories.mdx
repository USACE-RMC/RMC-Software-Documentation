# Structure Inventories

The next step after adding hydraulic data to the study is to add <strong>structure inventories</strong>. A structure inventory represents geospatial
points that contain damageable elements (typically a structure such as a home). Structure inventories are required and allow LifeSim to estimate
direct economic damage for a flood event. To estimate life loss for an event, a structure inventory must be supplied with population data.

<strong>Structure occupancy types</strong> provide a level of aggregation for structures in LifeSim and are imperative for any consequence
calculation. The occupancy types describe depth-damage relationships, life loss parameters, general information about the structures, and contain
information about uncertainty computations associated with the structure inventory. Each structure is required to have an occupancy type.

LifeSim Version 2.0 and later can accept structure inventories in the form of point shapefiles and the 
National Structure Inventory database (NSI) <Citation citationKey="NSI"/>. This chapter
describe the ways structure inventories in different formats can be added to, edited, and displayed in an LifeSim study.

## Import from Shapefile

The point shapefile that represents a structure inventory for an area will contain information on structure occupancy types (Appendix C), population,
structure values, foundation height, construction type, and other information. The LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 4, provides
 the definitions for the attributes required for importing a structure inventory from a shapefile.

#### To create a structure inventory from a point shapefile:

          A structure inventory has required attributes that will be used in an LifeSim study, so the user must provide information about those attributes in
          the selected point shapefile. From the <strong><u>Import Attributes</u></strong> column (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />), for each

          checkbox <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-checkbox.png"/> for that required 
          attribute (e.g., <em>Ground Floor Height</em> checked in <FigReference figKey="import-struc-occtype" />). In the <strong><u>Default Value</u></strong> column
          for that required attribute, the value box activates, and the user must enter a value for the required
          attribute (e.g., <em>9</em> in <FigReference figKey="import-struc-occtype" />). The user's defined default value will then be applied to 
          all structures in the inventory.

          click <strong>Next</strong>.
        </>
      ),
    },

### Default Occupancy Type Assignments

Next the user must confirm the occupancy type names from the structure shapefile associated with the occupancy type IDs that have been
defined in the study. Occupancy types are another level of aggregation for structures. Occupancy types are imperative for the consequence
calculations. Refer to [Occupancy Type Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#occupancy-type-editor) for more information on occupancy types.

<ProcessList
  items={[
    { // STEP 1
      title: (
        <>
          From the point shapefile, LifeSim tries to match up the occupancy type names to the occupancy type IDs that
          exist in the model (<FigReference figKey="occ-type-select" />). For example, in <FigReference figKey="occ-type-select" />,
          under <em>Occupancy Type</em>, the <em>Default Assignment</em> for <strong>RES1-1SNB</strong>, LifeSim selected
          selected <strong>RES1-1SNB</strong> from the existing occupancy types.
        </>
      ),
      freeform: (
        <>

      )
    },
    { // STEP 2
      title: (
        <>
          If the default selection is not correct, the user can change the assignment under the <em>Default
          Assignment</em> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="occ-dropdown" />).
        </>
      ),
      freeform: (
        <>
          <Figure
            figKey="occ-dropdown"

        </>
      ),
    },
    { // STEP 3
      title: (
        <>
          If the selected point shapefile does not contain a default occupancy type in the assigned field, then the dropdown menu will be empty. Users can
          check for different occupancy type names from the <em>Default Assignment</em> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="occ-dropdown" />).
        </>
      ),
    },
    { // STEP 4
      title: (
        <>
          Once the user has reviewed the default occupancy type assignments, from the <em>Import From Point Shapefile</em> dialog 
          box (<FigReference figKey="occ-type-select" />), click <strong>Next</strong>.
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

### Stability Criteria Assignments

Next the user must assign structure stability functions. Stability criteria are assigned to a structure based on rules that relate stability functions
 to identified attribute values. For example, if a rule states that all structures that are construction type ‘Wood’ should be assigned the
‘Wood-Framed Attached’ stability criteria, then once <strong>Finish</strong> is clicked, every structure that meets the criteria will be assigned the Wood-Framed
Attached stability function. These rules are not retained for future use. They are a one-time application to define the stability criteria that will
be used by structures. The assigned stability criteria can be viewed through the structure inventory's attribute table (see [View a Structure
Inventory](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#view-a-structure-inventory)). Refer to [Building Stability Curve
Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#building-stability-curve-editor) for further discussion on structure stability criteria.

LifeSim Version 2.0 and later has default rules that assign stability criteria for structures with specific construction and/or occupancy types. Alternatively,
the user may edit an existing default rule or create and define a new rule to assign stability criteria to structures based on any of the structure
attributes within the selected point shapefile. Note, the created rules are a 'rule stack,' meaning the order in which the criteria are defined is important.
If two rules apply to the same structure, then the higher (top) rule will dominate. Users should make certain all structures are covered by the
selected/created rules, for missed structures will not have a stability criteria assignment.

#### To assign default stability criteria:

<ProcessList
  items={[
    { // STEP 1
      title: (
        <>
          LifeSim provides a list of default rules for assigning stability criteria (<FigReference figKey="figure-75" />). For example,
          in <FigReference figKey="figure-75" />, the <em>Rule List</em> includes <strong>Steel Buildings Collapse Criteria</strong>. If a
          default rule in the <strong>Rule List</strong> is not desired, then the user can remove the rule. Default rules can also be modified.
        </>
      ),

        </>
      ),
    },
    { // STEP 2

## Import from National Structure Inventory (NSI)

The National Structure Inventory (NSI) for an area, will contain information on structure occupancy types, population, structure values, foundation
height, build type, and other information. The NSI is currently only available to U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) users. The NSI is a database of
structure locations and attributes and was developed using information from the HAZUS database and other sources including the Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics database. Technical documentation 
is available <a href="https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/confluence/nsi/technicalreferences/latest/technical-documentation#id-.TechnicalDocumentationv2022-OverviewoftheNationalStructureInventory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

## View and Edit a Structure Inventory

An imported structure inventory can be copied or deleted, viewed in the map window, appended with new structures, population information can be imported,
and new stability criteria rules can be created.

To access the <em>Study Tree</em> shortcut commands and edit an imported structure inventory, from the LifeSim main window, from 
the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <em>Study Tree</em>, from the <strong>Structure
Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory. The structure inventory shortcut menu opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-79"/>).
Commands include **Show In (or Remove From) Map Window**, **Tools**, **Move Up**, **Move Down**, **Copy**, and **Delete**. The <strong>Tools</strong> shortcut 
submenu (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />) contain commands for appending the structure inventory, importing population, and adding stability
assignment criteria rules.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-79"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure79.png"
  alt="LifeSim Study Tree – Imported Structure Inventory Shortcut Commands"
  caption="LifeSim Study Tree – Imported Structure Inventory Shortcut Commands"
/>

When a structure inventory is imported, default criteria for damage, stability, and submergence are assigned to structures based on the occupancy type
attribute information and the stability criteria rules. The criteria for structure damage, stability, and submergence can be edited, created, and
assigned. [Occupancy Type Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#occupancy-type-editor) and [Building Stability Curve
Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#building-stability-curve-editor) describe how to edit the occupancy types and structure inventory criteria,
respectfully.

Editing individual structures or attributes of the imported structure inventory map layer can be accomplished from the **Map Layers** tab; review
[Appendix B](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx) for information regarding editing the structure inventory map layer.

### View a Structure Inventory

Users can view the structure inventory in the map window and can view the structure inventory attributes.

#### Show in Map Window

From the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <em>Study Tree</em>, from
the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory. From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />),
click <strong>Show In Map Window</strong>. The selected structure inventory will display in the map window of the LifeSim 
main window (<FigReference figKey="strucs-displayed"/>). Right-click a displayed structure inventory and click <strong>Remove From
Map Window</strong> from the shortcut menu to stop displaying the structure inventory.

  alt="Example: LifeSim Main Window – Structure Inventory Displayed in Map Window"
  caption="Example: LifeSim Main Window – Structure Inventory Displayed in Map Window"
/>

#### View Attributes Table

Map layer attributes can be accessed for each map layer and is provided in a table for the dataset referenced by the map layer. The structure
inventory dataset must be displayed in the map window before the attribute table can be accessed. To access a specific map layer's attribute table, from
the **Map Layers** tab, right-click on a map layer of interest, and click **Open Attribute Table** (<FigReference figKey="strucs-displayed"/>). The Map Layer Attributes dialog box
opens; review [Map Layer Attributes Dialog Box](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#map-layer-attributes-dialog-box) for more information. Editing of
the map layer attributes is detailed in [Editing Map Layer Features and
Attributes](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#editing-map-layer-features-and-attributes).

### Append Structures

Structures can be appended to from a point shapefile or from NSI.

#### Append from a Shapefile

To append the structure inventory from a shapefile, from the LifeSim main window, from the
<strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <em>Study Tree</em>, from the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure
inventory (e.g., <em>Example_NSI</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-79" />). From the structure inventory shortcut menu, point to
<strong>Tools</strong> and select <strong>Append Structures From Shapefile</strong> submenu command. The <em>Append Structures From Shapefile</em> dialog 
box opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-81" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-81"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure81.png"
  alt="Example – Append From Point Shapefile Dialog Box"
  caption="Example – Append From Point Shapefile Dialog Box"
/>

Alternatively, to open the <em>Append Structures From Shapefile</em> dialog box, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, point to
<strong>Append From Shapefile</strong> and select the structure inventory (<FigReference figKey="append-menu" />).

<Figure

  alt="Study Menu - Structure Inventories - Append From Shapefile"
  caption="Study Menu - Structure Inventories - Append From Shapefile"
/>

Select the appropriate shapefile and define the structure attribute information, the default occupancy type assignments, and the stability criteria
assignment for the point shapefile. Except for adding a name, the <em>Append Structures From Shapefile</em> dialog box
requires the same steps as the *Import From Point Shapefile* dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-70" />); refer to [Import from
Shapefile](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#import-from-shapefile) for detailed instructions on completing the *Import From Point Shapefile* dialog box.

#### Append from NSI

Alternatively, users can append structures from NSI. To append the structure inventory from NSI, from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from 
the *Study Tree*, from the <strong>Structure
Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory. From the structure inventory shortcut menu, point to <strong>Tools</strong> and
select <strong>Append Structures From NSI</strong> submenu command (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />). 

Alternatively, to open 
the <em>Import Structures From NSI</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-82" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point 
to <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, point to <strong>Append From NSI</strong>, and select the structure inventory (<FigReference figKey="append-menu" />).

Either way, the <em>Import Structures From NSI</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-82" />) opens. Except for adding a name, the
<em>Import Structures From NSI</em> dialog box for appending structures requires the same steps as the
<em>Import Structures From NSI</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-78" />); refer to [Import from
NSI](#import-from-national-structure-inventory-nsi) for detailed instructions on completing the <em>Import Structures From NSI</em> dialog
box.

<Figure

  alt="Import Structures From NSI – Appending a Structure Inventory"
  caption="Import Structures From NSI – Appending a Structure Inventory"
/>

### Import Population from LEHD

Users can import population information for a structure inventory from 
the <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database</a>. 

From the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the
*Study Tree*, from the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory (e.g.,
<em>Example_NSI</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-79" />). From the structure inventory shortcut menu, point to <strong>Tools</strong>
and select <strong>Import Population From LEHD</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />) submenu command. The <em>Import Population From
LEHD</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-83" />) opens.

The <em>Import Population From LEHD</em> dialog box contains a table providing two editable columns
(**Day Households** and **Night Households**) for users to define the household size for each occupancy type. The
entered household size is used to distribute the imported population. Note: all household values must be greater than zero. Cells containing a value
of zero are highlighted in red as in <FigReference figKey="figure-83" />. Shortcut menu commands provide users with the ability to **Add, Insert, and Delete
Row(s)**; **Select All**; **Copy**; **Copy w/ Headers**, and **Paste**. Open the shortcut menu by right-clicking the row(s) of interest.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-83"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure83.png"
  alt="Import Population From LEHD Dialog Box – Shortcut Menu – Example with Errors"
  caption="Import Population From LEHD Dialog Box – Shortcut Menu – Example with Errors"
/>

Once the day and night household cells contain the correct household size, click <strong>OK</strong> to import the population. Note: An error message opens when 
cells do not contain values greater than zero and the
<strong>OK</strong> button is clicked (<FigReference figKey="figure-84" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-84"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure84.png"
  alt="LifeSim Error Message"
  caption="LifeSim Error Message"
/>

Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the error message and return to the <em>Import
Population From LEHD</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-83" />). Fix the cell(s) with zero values, and click <strong>OK</strong> to import
the population.

### Assign Stability Criteria

Stability criteria can be assigned to a structure based on rules that relate stability functions to identified attribute values of the structure. The
stability criteria assignment tool will take the rules that are defined and use them to assign the selected stability criteria to each structure that
meets the rules. For example, if a rule states that all structures that are construction type ‘Wood’ should be assigned the ‘Wood-Framed Attached’
stability criteria, then once **OK** is clicked, every structure that meets the criteria will be assigned the Wood-Framed Attached stability function.
These rules are not retained for future use. They are a one-time application to define the stability criteria that will be used by structures. The
assigned stability criteria can be viewed through the structure inventory attribute table (see [View a Structure
Inventory](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#view-a-structure-inventory)). Refer to [Building Stability Curve
Editor](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#building-stability-curve-editor) for further discussion on structure stability criteria.

Users can create structure inventory specific stability criteria assignment rules from the <em>Stability Criteria Assignment
Tool</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />). To open the dialog box, from the *Study Tree*,
right-click the structure inventory name. From the shortcut menu, point
to <strong>Tools</strong>, and select <strong>Assign Stability Criteria</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />). The <em>Stability Criteria Assignment
Tool</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />) opens.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-85"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure85.png"
  alt="Stability Criteria Assignment Tool Dialog Box"
  caption="Stability Criteria Assignment Tool Dialog Box"
/>

LifeSim Version 2.0 and later has default rules that assign stability criteria for structures with specific construction and/or occupancy types. To load the
default rules, click the <strong>Load Defaults</strong> button. Alternatively, the user may edit an existing default rule or create and define a new
rule based on any of the structure attributes within the selected structure inventory. Note: the created rules are a 'rule stack' meaning the order in
which the criteria are defined is important. If two rules apply to the same structure, then the higher (top) rule will dominate. Users should make
certain all structures are covered by the selected/created rules, for missed structures will not have a stability criteria assignment.

The *Import From Point Shapefile* dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-75" />) requires the same steps as the *Stability Criteria Assignment Tool
dialog* box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />); refer to [Stability Criteria
Assignments](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#stability-criteria-assignments) for detailed instructions on completing the *Stability Criteria Assignment
Tool* dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />).

### Copy a Structure Inventory

To copy an existing structure inventory, from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from
the *Study Tree*, from the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder, right-click on a structure inventory. From the shortcut 
menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-79" />), click <strong>Copy</strong>. Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from 
the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Structure
Inventories</strong>, point to <strong>Copy</strong> (<FigReference figKey="append-menu" />), and click on a structure inventory.

Either way, the <em>Name of New Study Item</em> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />) opens. Enter a new name in the
<strong>Name</strong> box. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <em>Name of New Study Item</em> dialog box
closes, and the copied structure inventory is added to the <em>Study Tree</em> under the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder.

/>

Click <strong>Yes</strong>, the *Confirm Delete* message window will close, and the selected
structure inventory is deleted. It will no longer display in the *Study Tree* under the <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> folder.

## Occupancy Type Editor

Each structure is required to have an <strong>occupancy type</strong>. Occupancy types are a subcategory of the default <strong>damage
categories</strong> assigned to a study and describe a class of structures (e.g., RES1-1SNB is a single family residential structure that is one
story tall with no basement). <strong>Damage categories</strong> represent a high level grouping for structures. They are used in the Economic
Consequence Assessment Model (ECAM) process to determine population and capital impacted for each event. In other words, damage categories represent a
grouping of occupancy types. By default, a LifeSim study is pre-loaded with default damage categories and occupancy types. Default damage categories
are residential, commercial, industrial, and public. Default occupancy types follow the naming convention developed for HAZUS (FEMA 2019) and are
listed in the *LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Appendix D*.

Users can modify default occupancy types or create and define new occupancy types with unique depth-damage functions and uncertainty parameters.
However, entered data is applied to all the structures assigned to a created or modified occupancy type. Several occupancy types can be assigned to a
single damage category. For example, single-story structures with no basements, single-story structures with basements, mobile homes, and duplex
apartments are different structure occupancy types assigned to a residential damage category. Structure inventories imported from NSI will
automatically have the LifeSim default occupancy types defined as attributes. Structures imported from point shapefiles require users to match the
shapefiles occupancy types with the LifeSim preloaded default occupancy type assignment (review [Default Occupancy Type
Assignments](./06-structure-inventories.mdx#default-occupancy-type-assignments)).

Data describing an occupancy type include: the depth-percent damage functions (structure, content, vehicle and other); the evacuation parameters;
submergence criteria; and the uncertainties in the first foundation height offset, submergence criteria, variation in values (structure, content
vehicle and other) as a percent; and the damage in the depth-damage functions.

The <em>Occupancy Type Editor</em> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) allows the user to revise and create the evacuation parameters,
submergence criteria, economic damage depth-damage functions, value uncertainty, and foundation height uncertainty associated with structures that
share common attributes (and therefore grouped by damage category). Also, from the editor, a user can assign damage criteria based on any combination
of structure damage category, occupancy class, number of stories, basement information and construction type.

### Occupancy Type Editor Structure

To open the <em>Occupancy Type Editor</em> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />), from the LifeSim main
window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, and click <strong>Edit Occupancy 
Types</strong> (<FigReference figKey="append-menu" />). 

Alternatively, from the *Study Tree*,
under <strong>Structure Inventories</strong>, right-click on <strong>Occupancy Types</strong>. From the shortcut menu, click <strong>Edit Occupancy
Type Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-89" />).

#### Occupancy Type Data

From the <em>Occupancy Type Editor</em> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />), the right side of the editor contains the data entered for the
selected occupancy type (e.g., **RES1-1SNB** in <FigReference figKey="figure-88" />). Directly below the <strong>Occupancy Type Name</strong>
field is the <strong>Description</strong> field; both fields can be edited. Modify or set the damage category for selected occupancy type using
the <strong>Damage Category</strong> dropdown menu; the menu contains the list of default damage categories (and any user added damage
categories). Edit or set the uncertainty in the foundation height offset from the <strong>Foundation Height Offset</strong> panel. Add or edit the
structure, content, vehicle, and other depth-damage functions from the set of tabs located within the <strong>Economic
Damage</strong> tab; set the warning and protective action behavior from the <strong>Evacuation Parameters</strong> tab; and
set the uncertainty in the high hazard heights from the <strong>Submergence Criteria</strong> tab. Review the next section to learn
how to create and define a new occupancy type in the <em>Occupancy Type Editor</em> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />).

### Create or Edit an Occupancy Type

The following sections describe how to create a new occupancy type and define the individual components of the occupancy type. Note, skip the
instructions for creating a new occupancy type and start from the damage category assignment section to learn how to editing an existing or copied
occupancy type.

#### Set the Evacuation Parameters

After completing the economic depth-damage functions for the new occupancy type, select the <strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong>
tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />). This tab contains evacuation parameters set for all structures assigned to the selected occupancy type.
Review the LifeSim Technical Reference Manual for more information regarding the evacuation parameters defined by the structure occupancy type.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-96"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure96.png"
  alt="Occupancy Type Editor – Evacuation Parameters Tab"
  caption="Occupancy Type Editor – Evacuation Parameters Tab"
/>

1. From the <strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />), define the following evacuation
parameters for the new occupancy type:

  - The user can set warning and protective action behavior for the selected occupancy type. If the <strong>Population in structure warned at the same
 time</strong> checkbox is selected (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) then the warning will reach all people in the structure at once instead of
at different times. For example, in an apartment building, residents could receive a warning at different times but for a single family residential
structure the warning will reach all people in the structure at the same time.

  - The user can also select <strong>Population in structure takes protective action at the same time</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />),
 this is where all of the people within the structure will try to evacuate at the same time. For example, in a single-family residential structure
everyone will try to evacuate at the same time but in a commercial structure everyone might try to evacuate at different times.

  - Enter the probability that the population of the structure can access the roof or attic of the structure in the <strong>Probability of access to
roof/attic (omitting limited mobility)</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) field. By default, the probability is set to
<em><strong>0.9</strong></em>, and the range of possible probabilities is 0.0 to 1.0.

  - In the <strong>Fraction to roof vs attic (if access if possible)</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) field, set the fraction of the
population of the structure that can access the roof. By default, the fraction for roof vs. attic is <em><strong>1</strong></em>; enter a value
between 0.0 and 1.0.

  - For the <strong>Fraction of population that evacuate in vehicles vs on foot</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />) field, enter the
fraction of the structure’s population that evacuate in vehicles vs. on foot. By default, the fraction for vehicle vs. on foot is
<em><strong>1</strong></em>; enter a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

  - By default, the <strong>Evacuating Group Size (e.g., number of people per evacuating vehicle)</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-96" />)
field is <em><strong>3</strong></em>. Enter the appropriate group size for the created occupancy type. For example, RES5 (institutional dormitories)
has a set group size of 48 to simulate evacuation by bus.

#### Enter the Submergence Criteria

<strong>Submergence</strong> is defined as a water level at a structure that can affect probability of survival. The <strong>submergence
criteria</strong> in LifeSim Version 2.0 is used to define the threshold between high hazard and low hazard conditions when people are trapped in a
flooded structure.

Note, in LifeSim Version 1.0, submergence criteria were divided into three zones: chance, compromised and safe. However, in LifeSim Version 2.0, the
original three zones were replaced with two new zones: low and high hazard. The LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 9, Section
9.2, provides a detailed explanation regarding the development of the two new zones. LifeSim Version 2.0 characterizes the high hazard or low hazard
conditions as described below:

- <strong>High Hazard Zone: </strong>Refers to those conditions where the stability criteria or submergence criteria of the person, the vehicle (if
caught while evacuating), or the structure (if not mobilized) has been exceeded. When the stability (or submergence) criteria has been exceeded
survival depends largely on chance.

- <strong>Low Hazard Zone: </strong>Refers to those conditions where the person or group of people are exposed to relatively calm floodwaters, where
the stability of the individual, group, or shelter is not at risk. A hazard exists due to the potential for bad things to happen when people come in
contact with water in locations not meant for such an interaction.

The threshold of submergence is an uncertain parameter sampled uniquely for each structure. Review the LifeSim Technical Reference Manual for more
information regarding the submergence criteria. To enter the submergence criteria for the High Hazard zone for the new occupancy type:

1. Select the <strong>Submergence Criteria</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-97" />) and set the uncertainty in the threshold of submergence
 from the <strong>Uncertainty Type</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-97" />), the user can chose <strong>Triangular</strong>,
<strong>Normal</strong> (standard deviation), and <strong>Uniform</strong> (minimum, maximum); or select <strong>None</strong> for no uncertainty. For
 the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-97" />, <strong>Triangular</strong> has been selected for all three criteria; therefore, the
<strong>Minimum</strong>, <strong>Most</strong> <strong>Likely</strong> and <strong>Maximum</strong> values need to be entered.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-97"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure97.png"
  alt="Occupancy Type Editor – Submergence Criteria Tab – Default Values"
  caption="Occupancy Type Editor – Submergence Criteria Tab – Default Values"
/>

1. Users set the threshold values for the three potential high hazard zones. If the depth of flooding is above the defined high hazard zone, then
people caught in the structure will be placed in the high hazard zone. The three submergence criteria are:

  - <strong>High Hazard Depth On Roof (ft)</strong> – users set the threshold for this high hazard zone with or without uncertainty by entering depth
(ft) as measured from the roof up. For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-97" />, the most likely value (or best estimate) is 4 ft
above the roof, with a minimum of 2 ft and maximum of 5 ft above the roof. In this case if the depth of flooding is above the <strong>High Hazard
Depth On Roof</strong> submergence criteria, then able-bodied people caught on the roof will be placed in the high hazard zone.

  - <strong>High Hazard Depth From Ceiling (ft)</strong> – users set the threshold for this high hazard zone with or without uncertainty by entering
depth (ft) as measured from the top of the ceiling (of the top floor of the building). For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-97" />
, the most likely value (or best estimate) is 1 ft below the ceiling, with a minimum of 0.5 ft and maximum of 1.5 ft below the ceiling. In this case
if the depth of flooding is above the <strong>High Hazard Depth From Ceiling</strong> submergence criteria, then able-bodied people caught in the
structure will be placed in the high hazard zone.

  - <strong>High Hazard Depth From Floor (ft)</strong> – users set the threshold for this high hazard zone with or without uncertainty by entering
depth (ft) as measured from floor towards the ceiling (of the top floor of the building). For the example provided in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-97" />, the most likely value (or best estimate) is 5 ft above the floor, with a minimum of 4 ft and maximum of 6
ft above the floor. In this case if the depth of flooding is above the <strong>High Hazard Depth From Floor</strong> submergence criteria, then
limited mobility occupants caught in the structure will be placed in the high hazard zone.

1. Once information about the selected occupancy type is entered, from the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />
), click <strong>OK</strong>. The <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> will close and the information for the new (or edited) occupancy type is
saved.

### Delete an Occupancy Type

From the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) select an occupancy type from the <strong>Occupancy Type
Name</strong> list. Click the <strong>Delete</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ff03d1c8.png" /> button and a
<strong>Confirm</strong> <strong>Delete</strong> window opens asking for confirmation to delete the selected item. Click <strong>Yes</strong>, the
<strong>Confirm</strong> <strong>Delete</strong> message window closes and the selected stability criteria is deleted.

### Copy an Occupancy Type

From the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) select an occupancy type from the <strong>Name</strong> list.
Click <strong>Copy</strong> <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-251c2a2b.png" />, the
<strong>Save Occupancy Type As</strong> dialog will open (<FigReference figKey="figure-92" />). Enter a new name in the <strong>Name</strong> box.
Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Save Occupancy Type As</strong> dialog box will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-92" />). Users will return
 to the <strong>Occupancy Type Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />) with the new occupancy type displayed.

## Building Stability Curve Editor

<strong>Stability criteria</strong> defines the depth and velocity threshold for total structure collapse due to a hazard. The threshold is defined by
 a depth – velocity curve. If at any time during a simulation the depth and velocity are at a point above the velocity curve then the structure is
assumed to be collapsed which can have significant impacts on estimated life loss. The building stability criteria is generally based on the construction
 type. The user can add, edit, and assign stability criteria based on the structure attributes: construction type, number of stories, occupancy type.
The <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) allows the user to define stability criteria for the
structure inventory.

### Building Stability Curve Editor Overview

Similar to the Occupancy Type Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-88" />), the Building Stability Curve Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />
) contains a tree on the left side to allow users to select a building stability criteria from the list of defaults. Selected stability criteria data
includes a Structural Stability Threshold plot and is displayed on the right side of the editor. The Structural Stability Threshold plot has a
toolbar; review [Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the
general plotting tools (located on the right side of the plot window) and for customizing plots. The Building Stability Curve Editor (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) has buttons for creating, deleting and copying a selected stability criteria. The following sections
describes the Building Stability Curve Editor (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) in more detail.

#### Tree

The left side of the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) provides a view of the stability criteria
 grouped by construction type in a tree (<strong>Stability Criteria Tree</strong>). From the <strong>Stability Criteria Tree</strong>, select a
stability criteria name to display the data describing the selected stability criteria in the right side of the editor.

#### Buttons

The <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) has buttons that allow for creating, deleting, and copying
 of stability criteria. In addition to the buttons, the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> allows the user to set the display units;
slide the bar to either <strong>US Customary</strong> or <strong>System</strong> <strong>International (SI)</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) to the desired display units. The button functions are listed:

- <strong>Restore Defaults: </strong>The <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> button removes all edits made to the default building stability curves.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Selecting the <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> button also removes all custom created stability criteria thresholds. To
restore the default building stability criteria, click the <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> button. The <strong>Clear Existing</strong> message
window (<FigReference figKey="figure-99" />) opens. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to close the <strong>Clear Existing</strong> message window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-99" />) and restore defaults. Click <strong>No</strong> to close the <strong>Clear Existing</strong> message window
 and load defaults without removing the existing occupancy types. Or Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to close the <strong>Clear Existing</strong>
message window without restoring defaults.

### Create or Edit a Building Stability Criteria

To create a new stability criteria:

1. To open the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />), from the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-68" />), from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, under <strong>Structure Inventories</strong> right-click on
<strong>Building Stability Criteria</strong> and from the shortcut menu click <strong>Building Stability Criteria Data</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-103" />). The <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) opens.

  caption="LifeSim Study Tree – Structure Inventories – Edit Building Stability Criteria Data Shortcut Command"
/>

1. From the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />), click the <strong>Add New</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-99d01699.png" /> button. The <strong>Name of New
Stability Criteria Threshold</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-100" />) opens.

1. Enter a name (required) in the <strong>Name</strong> box for the new stability criteria. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Name of New
Stability Criteria Threshold</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-100" />) closes. The <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong>
(<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />) displays the new blank stability criteria.

An existing stability criteria can be edited or a newly created criteria can be defined following the remaining instructions in this section.

1. Enter a description (optional but recommended) in the <strong>Description</strong> field (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />).

1. Next, enter the structural stability threshold curve in the table on the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-102" />). If adding uncertainty for the depth (ft) parameter, uncheck the  checkbox to disable the <strong>Velocity
 Uncertain Parameter</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />), by default the checkbox is unchecked.
Alternatively, add uncertainty for the velocity parameter, check the  checkbox to enable the <strong>Velocity Uncertain Parameter</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-105" />). Note, Depth (ft) is now the x-variable and Velocity (ft/s) is now the y-variable.

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure105.png"
  alt="Velocity Uncertain Parameter Enabled"
  caption="Velocity Uncertain Parameter Enabled"
/>

1. From the <strong>Distribution Type</strong> dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />), select the desired distribution type for the
y-variable. By default, <strong>Deterministic</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-105" />) is selected. The distribution types available are:

  - <strong>Normal</strong> – mean (μ), standard deviation (σ).

  - <strong>Truncated Normal</strong> – mean (μ), standard deviation (σ), minimum, maximum.

  - <strong>Log-Normal</strong> – mean (of log, μ), standard deviation (of log, σ).

  - <strong>Triangular</strong> – minimum (a), most likely (c), maximum (b).

  - <strong>Uniform</strong> – minimum, maximum.

1. The threshold depth – velocity curve can be entered into the Structural Stability Threshold Table (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />) by hand,
copied from another stability criteria or from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) and pasted into the table (i.e., entire table, individual
cells, columns, rows). From the Structural Stability Threshold Table, right-click to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-104" />), from
 the shortcut menu the user can add, insert, and delete row(s); select all; copy or copy with headers; and paste.
For example, from another stability criteria select a cell in the table and use Ctrl + A (or right-click and select the Select All command from the
shortcut menu), to select the entire table. Use Ctrl + C (or the Copy shortcut menu command) to copy the data to the clipboard. Return to the newly
created stability criteria and select the first cell in the first row and use Ctrl + V to paste all the copied data.
The stability threshold table can also be copied (with or without headers) into another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) for saving. Use Ctrl + A
(or the Select All command from the shortcut menu), right-click and select Copy w/ Headers. Then paste the data in the desired application to save.
Errors in the stability threshold table are highlighted in red and a tooltip displays a message describing the error (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />). Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-95" />) to sort the
table in ascending or descending order, or clear the table sorting.
The Structural Stability Threshold plot (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) provides a live update for the data entered in the table. Review
[Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting
 tools (located on the right side of the plot window) and for customizing plots.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Building Stability Curve Editor</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-98" />) closes and saves all edits
to building stability curves.
