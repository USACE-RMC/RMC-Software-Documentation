# LifeSim Interface

The LifeSim interface allows users to enter data, review data, create alternatives, run simulations, and review results.

## Main Window

The main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1"/> below and shown on the previous page) displays the framework for the LifeSim software.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-1"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure1.png"
  alt="LifeSim Main Window"
  caption="LifeSim Main Window"
/>

The main window is organized with a *Title Bar*, a *Menu Bar*, two tabs (**Study** and **Map
Layers**), a *Map Window* (with an associated toolbar), and the *Status Bar*. The following describes basic
elements of the main window:

- **Title Bar**: Displays the Version number (Version 2.1.6), for Version 2.0 and above, and the name of the active LifeSim study.

- **Menu Bar**: Contains the LifeSim menus.

- **Study and Map Layers Tabs**
  - The **Study** tab contains a *Study Tree* that guides users when adding the building blocks of an LifeSim
    study. 
  - The **Map Layers** tab contains a list of all map layers that are currently part of the active study. Clicking a tab opens the tab specific
    information and commands.

- **Map Window**: Used to graphically display the LifeSim study components and imported map layers, which are geographically referenced
(geo-referenced).

- **Map Toolbar**: Contains tools used to setup, navigate, and edit within the LifeSim map window.

- **Status Bar**: Displays messages related to incoming data and status of the LifeSim software for informational purposes.

## Menu Bar

The menu bar (<FigReference figKey="newfigure-3"/>) of LifeSim provides the user with many commands to perform various functions. An overview for each menu in LifeSim software is provided.

<Figure
  figKey="newfigure-3"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/newfigure-3.png"
  alt="LifeSim Menu Bar"
  caption="LifeSim Menu Bar"
/>

- **File**: The File menu allows the user to perform study management functions such as creating, opening, closing, and saving an
LifeSim study. Available commands are: **Create New**, **Open Existing**, **Save**, **Save As**, **Zip Project**, **Compress Project**, and **Exit**. This menu also displays a
list of previously opened LifeSim studies and selecting one automatically opens the selected study.

- **Mapping**: From the Mapping menu, users can add or remove map layers from the **Map Layers** tab, shown in the map window. 
  - Map layers that can be added to an LifeSim study are: *.shp, *.flt, *.tif, *.vrt, or Web Imagery layers. 
  - Other available functions from the Mapping menu are creating vector layers
    and modifying or importing map projections. 
  - Available commands are: **Add Map Layer**, **Add Web Layer**, **Create New Vector Layer**, **Remove Map Layer**,
    and **Map Properties**.

- **Study**: From the Study menu, users can import, create, modify, and edit the building blocks of an LifeSim study. Commands include
Hydraulic Data, Structure Inventories, Emergency Planning Data, Road Network Data, Destinations Data, Agricultural Crop Data, ECAM Data, Alternatives
and Simulations.

- **Help**: Displays a copy of the LifeSim User's Manual current version; and information about LifeSim.

## Tabs

The [LifeSim main window](#figure-1) is organized into two tabs that allow the user to view, enter, and edit LifeSim study
data or to view and manipulate any map layer geographically in the map window.

- **Study Tab**: Allows a user to view, add, and edit data; and add/remove map layers for an LifeSim study. The Study tab is the default
tab and provides a view of the study data in a tree (*Study Tree*). Also, from the *Study Tree*, a user can create, edit, and delete datasets, alternatives
 and simulations. The *Study Tree* lists datasets, alternatives and simulations that have been created.

- **Map Layers Tab**: The Map Layers tab provides a list of the map layers in a tree (Map Layers Tree). From the Map Layers tab, a user
can import, create, edit and delete map layers. The Map Layers Tree allows users to also display map layers in the map window. However, only selected
layers in the Map Layers tab will display in the map window. The user can turn map layers on or off, adjust the properties of the layers, modify the
order of the layers for viewing in the map window. Appendix A provides greater detail on the Map Layers tab and associated map window.

## Map Window

The Map Window (<FigReference figKey="figure-5" />) in LifeSim provides a way to graphically display LifeSim components. This section is designed to
give a brief overview of what is available in the map window and map layers. For more detail on the mapping functionality in LifeSim, refer to
[Appendix B](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#appendix-b-map-references).

The **Map Window Toolbox** (<FigReference figKey="figure-5" />) contains three toolbars. The first toolbar is the **General
Toolbar**, second is the **Selectable Layers** **Toolbar**, and third is the **Editor Toolbar**. If a
tool has a parenthesis after the tooltip, the letter in the parentheses represents a hot key that allows a user to access the tool through the
keyboard. For example, to access the **Query** tool **(Q)** through keyboard selections, the user will click the
**Shift-Q** keys over the map window. This will activate the **Query** tool. A list of all of the hot keys is located in
Appendix B.

### General Toolbar

The General Toolbar includes the Select Tool (B), Pan Tool (P), Zoom In Tool (Z), Zoom to full extents, Add Data, Query Features Tool (Q), and Measure
 Distance Tool (M). These tools change the appearance of the cursor, as well as the functionality of the mouse cursor in the map window.

-  Select Tool (B): The Select tool allows the user to select elements displayed in the map window that are currently selected in the Selectable
Layers. More details on Selectable Layers can be found in the next section. To select features, click on a feature or click, hold, and drag a
rectangle around features to select them in the map window. Additionally, the Select tool allows users to access shortcut menus which can be used to
customize features when in editing mode. Refer to [Appendix B](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#appendix-b-map-preferences) for more information
regarding editing mode.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-c6751277.png" />** Pan Tool (P): **The
**Pan** tool allows the user to pan the map window; click the **Pan** tool and click, hold and move the mouse around the map
 window. Also, if the mouse has a wheel then the user can pan the map window by using the wheel (click and hold the wheel to pan).

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-6cd2df7a.png" />** Zoom In Tool (Z):
**The **Zoom In** tool allows the user to zoom in to areas of the map window. To zoom in, hold the mouse button down and outline
the area of interest to enlarge. Also, if the mouse has a wheel then the user can zoom in or out using the wheel (wheel up zooms in and wheel down
zooms out).

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-2934ef6e.png" />** Fixed Zoom Out Tool (O):
**The **Fixed Zoom Out** tool zooms out to a fixed distance. Click the **Fixed Zoom Out** icon once and the LifeSim
map window view will zoom out a fixed distance. Double-click on the tool icon and the map window view will zoom out twice the fixed distance (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-6" />). Additionally, the user can utilize the shortcut menu option, right-click anywhere in the map window, to
zoom in or out a fixed distance.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-6"

  alt="Fixed Zoom Out tool."
  caption="Fixed Zoom Out tool."
/>

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ddd93902.png" />** Zoom to full extents Tool:
**The **Zoom to full extents** tool is a quick way to re-center the map by zooming out to the full geo-graphical extent of the map
 layers in the map window. Web layers do not affect the map extents.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-8aec7046.png" />** Add Data Tool:
**Click the **Add Data** tool, the **Browse for files** browser will open. This browser allows users to navigate to
layers (including <em>&#42;.shp</em>, <em>&#42;.flt</em>, <em>&#42;.tif</em>, and <em>&#42;.vrt</em>) of interest and add the layer(s) to the map window. If the user
clicks the down arrow next to the **Add Data** tool a shortcut menu will appear which allows the user to add data, add web imagery, or
create new data that is added to the map window.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-7"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure7.png"
  alt="Add Data Tool."
  caption="Add Data Tool."
/>

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-878d4d2c.png" />** Query Features Tool (Q):
**The **Query Features** tool identifies the geographic feature or place currently selected in the map window. Alternatively,
multiple features can be identified by dragging a box over the desired area. Once a selection is made the **Feature Query** dialog box
will open with the information presented in table format separated by **Feature** type. Only visible layers in the map window will be
queried and the **Selectable Layers** option does not modify the **Query Features** tool.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ca04fae1.png" />** Measure Distance Tool (M):
**The **Measure Distance** tool allows the user to measure the distance along a specified line. With the tool selected, click to
initiate the measure line. Each subsequent click will add a new point to the measure line. When finished, double-click on the location of the final
point. The **Measure Results** dialog box will open and display the distance in the units the user has chosen (feet, miles, meters, or
kilometers).

### Selectable Layers Toolbar

Selectable Layers Toolbar allows the user to turn on and off map layers of a study using the Select tool from the Selectable Layers Toolbar. The list
of options depends on the maps layers located in the Map Layers tab, except Internet (web) layers. For further explanation on the use of Selectable
Layers, refer to [Add Features to the Destination Locations Map
Layer](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#add-features-to-the-destination-locations-map-layer).

### Editor Toolbar

The set of tools located in the **Editor Toolbar** initiate an editing session for the selected layer. When a user right-clicks on a map
layer in the **Map** **Layers** tab, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-8" />), click
**Edit**, and the tools in the **Editor Toolbar** become active. Only one map layer can be edited at one time. For lines and
 polygons, there are two editing modes: feature edit, and vertex edit. Clicking on a selected feature puts the user into the feature edit mode (move,
delete, reverse), double-clicking on a selected feature puts the user in the vertex edit mode (add, delete, edit vertex points).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-8"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure8.png"
  alt="Map Layers Tree Shortcut Menu"
  caption="Map Layers Tree Shortcut Menu"
/>

There are some tools available during an edit session which are not available from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-8" />) or the
Editor Toolbar. Clicking Delete will delete all currently selected features or currently selected vertices depending on which mode the user is in.
Clicking the R key will reverse the direction of a currently selected line feature. Also, right-clicking during an edit session allows the user to do
multiple tasks depending on what is clicked. Detailed information on all of the functionality of the editing tools is available in [Appendix
B](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#appendix-b-map-preferences).

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-15ecf4f5.png" />** Add new features Tool (A):
**The **Add new features** tool allows the user to add a new feature to the editable map layer by left-clicking to add feature
data. Selected features can be deleted by either clicking the **Delete** key, or right-click on the selected feature(s) and from the
shortcut menu click **Delete Selected Features**.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-7398525a.png" />** Insert vertex Tool
(I):** The **Insert vertex** tool allows the user to add a vertex to an existing line or polygon map layer. The **Insert
vertex** tool becomes available when the selected feature is in the vertex edit mode. As the cursor gets close to the line or polygon edge the
map window will display what the updated feature will look like if a vertex is added at the cursor. Left-click to insert the new vertex.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-e9d16d85.png" />** Break line feature into two
line features at a defined location Tool (K): **The **Break line feature** tool will split a line feature into two features at the
 point the user clicked on the line. The user needs to be in the feature edit mode for this tool to be enabled.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-cf9d34fc.png" />** Continue from end Tool
(lines only): **The **Continue from end (lines only) **tool will continue a line feature from the end point of the line feature to
 the point to a second point clicked in the map window. Double-click to finish the line continuation edits or right-click and choose **Finish
Editing Vertices** or choose a different tool to finish the line continuation. The user needs to be in the vertex edit mode for this tool to be
 enabled.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-3da2817d.png" />** Add new line or polygon to
existing feature Tool: **The **Add new line or polygon to existing feature** tool will allow the user to add a polygon or line to
an existing selected polygon or line feature. For example, to add a hole to a polygon, click to add points defining the hole and double-click to
finish. The user needs to be in the vertex edit mode for this tool to be enabled.

- <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-d15e7265.png" />** Feature Snapping Settings
Tool: **The **Feature Snapping Settings** tool allows the user to define snapping rules when editing. Snapping will automatically
move the desired action to the nearest snap point when the cursor is close. This can be very useful when trying to line up endpoints of line features
or place points directly on top of other features. Enable snapping by clicking **Enable Snapping**. From the **Snap to
Feature** list, select the desired feature to snap to, then select how snapping will be applied (all points, end points, or edges).

### Customizing Plots Overview

From the **Plot Properties** dialog, opened by clicking the **Plot Properties**
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-de98cf5b.png" /> tool or right clicking on a plot
and selecting an edit option, from specific plot windows. The **Plot Properties** dialog allows the user to configure multiple display
properties for the individual plot, including **GENERAL PLOT SETTINGS** (<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />), the
**LEGEND** (<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />), **AXES** (<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />), data
**SERIES** curves (<FigReference figKey="figure-22" />), and plot **ANNOTATIONS** (<FigReference figKey="figure-22" /> and
 <FigReference figKey="figure-23" />). Access different customization editors (e.g., **LEGEND** in <FigReference figKey="figure-19" />
), by toggling through the plot properties dropdown menu to access the different editing options.

Depending on the plot properties dropdown menu selection, the **Plot** **Properties** dialog updates to include a selector
dropdown menu and expandable sections. For example, the **AXES** (<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />) editor includes a dropdown menu
to allow users to select the x- or y-axis and also contains three tabs for editing the general, labels, or grid lines. Click the section
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-02ccf6e7.png" /> arrow to expand the section, or
collapse the section by clicking the expand
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-70643b36.png" /> button (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />).

Depending on the expanded editing section users can enter text labels, choose the color, and/or use dropdown menus to modify the size, type, weight,
padding, and/or alignment of the specified component of the plot. In general, checkboxes
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-271d0622.png" /> allow users to turn on or off the
 display of an item (e.g., turn on or off the visibility of the legend from the **LEGEND** **AREA** section displayed in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />).

Once customization of the plot properties has been completed click the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-1a1a406a.png" /> **Close**
**Plot** **Properties** button, or the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-fea86a8d.png" /> **Close** dialog
button (<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />).

/>

To edit the default color selection, click the color box to open a color chooser window (<FigReference figKey="figure-20" />). The color chooser
window provides a large color picker box (tint varies along the left axis, tone varies along the right axis, and saturation varies along the top axis)
 a vertical color hue slider bar, a **Transparency** horizontal slider bar, and a **Selected** **Colors**
section that provides several default color swatches (<FigReference figKey="figure-20" />).

Use the vertical hue slider bar to select a color (e.g., blue in <FigReference figKey="figure-20" />) and use the color picker box to choose the
desired shade, tint and tone (adding black, white and gray respectively) for the chosen color. Selecting a color in the color chooser window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-20" />) automatically updates the color box in **Plot** **Properties** dialog (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />).

#### General Plot Settings

By default, the **Plot** **Properties** dialog opens with the **GENERAL PLOT SETTINGS** (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />) selected from the dropdown menu. Options for modifying the plot general settings includes the plot title,
subtitle, plot area and background. To access the general settings options, click the section
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-02ccf6e7.png" /> arrow to expand
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-70643b36.png" /> the section (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />).

#### Legend

To modify the legend properties, select **LEGNED** from the **Plot** **Properties** dropdown menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />). Users can modify the title, items, area, and position of the plot legend. Note, if making modifications to
 the legend make sure the **Legend** **Visible** (<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />) checkbox is
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-5e733e91.png" /> checked or the legend will not
display in the plot window.

#### Axes

To edit the plot axes, select **AXES** from the **Plot** **Properties** dropdown menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />). When modifying the plot axes, choose the axis (e.g., <em>**Y Values**</em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />) and the component to modify, by selecting the **GENERAL**, **LABELS**, or
**GRID** **LINES** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />). From the **GENERAL** tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />), modify the axis minimum, maximum, axis type, or axis display properties. From the **LABELS**
tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />), edit the axis label, text color, font, distance from the axis and/or enter the units for the axis. From
the **GRID** **LINES** tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-21" />), modify the major and minor grid lines and the tick mark
options.

  caption="Plot Properties – AXES Options – GENERAL (left) – LABELS (middle) – GRID LINES (right)"
/>

#### Data Series Curves

The data series curves can be modified, by selecting **SERIES** from the **Plot** **Properties** dropdown menu
(<FigReference figKey="figure-22" />). Users can select the specific data series in the plot (e.g., Time Series in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-22" />) when more than one data series is displayed in a plot window. Users can modify the series display and
markers (if applicable). For example, if the series is a time series hydrograph, then the display and marker sections are available to modify the line
 and marker style, color, thickness and size can be modified. However, if the series is box and whisker then only the display section is available to
modify the box and line style, color, thickness and size can be modified.

#### Annotations

To add annotations, from the **Plot** **Properties** dropdown menu, select **ANNOTATIONS** (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-22" />). Depending on the plot, default annotations will already be added to the plot. For the example provided in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-15" />, the default annotations included in the time series hydrograph are the First Timestep (green vertical
dashed line with text) and Hazard Occurrence (red vertical dashed line with label). Users can modify the text and display properties of existing or
added annotations. For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-22" />, the <em>**First Timestep**</em> annotation is
selected from the annotation dropdown menu and the **TEXT** and **DISPLAY** sections are expanded to display the default
First Timestep annotation properties.

  alt="Plot Properties – SERIES (left) – ANNOTATIONS (right)"
  caption="Plot Properties – SERIES (left) – ANNOTATIONS (right)"
/>

Add an additional annotation to the plot by selecting the desired annotation type from the dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-23" />).
Annotation types include arrow, text, line, rectangle, ellipse, point, polygon, or polyline. Users also have the option to removed added annotations
(including default annotations) by clicking the **Delete Annotation**
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ed0e6b75.png" /> button.

## Animation Toolbar

When animations are viewed in a map window an Animation Toolbar (<FigReference figKey="figure-24" />) appears. For example, from the RAS Map Data
Selector dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-25" />) users can import hydraulic data from a RAS map. Another example is when users view
hydraulic or evacuation animations results in the map window (refer to [View Result Map in the Map
Window](./14-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#view-result-map-in-the-map-window)).

From the **Animation Toolbar** at the bottom of the **RAS Map Data Selector** (<FigReference figKey="figure-25" />), the
user can view (animated) the HEC-RAS depth simulation for the specified plan. The controls for the animation bar function the same as the controls to
a video player. Use the slider bars to modify the speed (faster or slower) and position of the animation playback. To modify the animation settings,
click <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-6e55d4e0.png" />, the **Animation
Settings** dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-26" />) opens.

The user can export a copy of the animation, click
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-af73216d.png" />, the **Export Animation
Wizard** (<FigReference figKey="figure-27" />) opens. To save an animation output file, click , and a **Save As** browser window
opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-3" />). Navigate to the location (directory) to save to plot, enter a name (required) in the **File
name** box for the plot and select the file type from the available options (<em>&#42;.mp4</em>, <em>&#42;.wmv</em>). Click **Save**, the
**Save** **As** browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-3" />) will close. From the **Export Animation Wizard**
(<FigReference figKey="figure-28" />), set the desired **Start** and **End Window**, **Timer Position**, and
**Frame Rate**. To complete the export, click **OK**. The progress bar at the bottom of the **Export Animation
Wizard** (<FigReference figKey="figure-28" />) provides the progress of creating the video file, and once complete the **Export
Animation Wizard** (<FigReference figKey="figure-28" />) closes.
