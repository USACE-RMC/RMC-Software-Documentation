# Viewing LifeSim Results

When a simulation has been created for an LifeSim study the simulation should be computed and the results reviewed. During a simulation compute,
summary results for each iteration are written out to a database, the user can then generate detailed iteration results to view agent level simulation
 data such as animations and evacuation timing. Agent level refers to viewing results down to the vehicle or evacuating group level. The detailed
iteration results are computed per iteration to save both storage space and computation time. Results include summary tabulated results by iteration,
summary box and whisker plots, plot by iteration and plot by uncertainty. In addition, detailed output can be generated by iteration allowing the user
 to animate the simulation in the map window and view detailed iteration plot results.

## Simulation Results Options

LifeSim Version 2.0 provides users with the ability to view summary results for all simulations or results for individual simulations. To view the
simulation summary results for all simulations, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-189" />), from the Study tab, from the
Study Tree, right-click Simulations (<FigReference figKey="figure-189" />), and click Simulation Result Plots or Simulation Result Table from the
shortcut menu. Alternatively, from the Study menu, point to Simulations and click View Results Plot or View Results Table from the sub-menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-190" />). [Open Summary Results](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#open-summary-results) provides an overview of the
 summary results for all simulations.

NOTE: All results plot windows contain the same general plotting tools (located on the right side of the plot window) used for customizing plots.
Review [Customizing Plots and Plotting Tools](./05-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general
plotting tools.

### Simulation Result Plots

The <strong>Simulation Result Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-189" />), <strong>Study Tree | Simulations</strong> shortcut menu command
opens the <strong>Results</strong> <strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-192" />). The
<strong>Results</strong> <strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-192" />) is divided into three main panels.
The first panel located at the top left, is the <strong>Simulation Results By Iteration</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-192" />). The
second panel located at the bottom left, is the <strong>Simulation</strong> <strong>Results</strong> <strong>By</strong> <strong>Structure</strong>
panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-192" />). The third panel located on the right-side is the plot window containing two tabs: <strong>Box and
Whisker Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-192" />) and <strong>Iteration</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-193" />).

However, there is a fourth optional panel, the <strong>Filter</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-194" />) is an expandable panel that is

  alt="Example – Results Summary Plots – Box and Whisker Plots Tab"
  caption="Example – Results Summary Plots – Box and Whisker Plots Tab"
/>

Note, the <strong>Simulation Results By Iteration</strong> selection (e.g., <em><strong>Total Life Loss</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-194" />) updates the data displayed in the <strong>Box and Whisker Plots</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-192" />) and <strong>Iteration</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-193" />) tabs.
However, the <strong>Simulation</strong> <strong>Results</strong> <strong>By</strong> <strong>Structure</strong> selection (e.g., <em><strong>Maximum
Depth</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-195" />) only updates the <strong>Box and Whisker Plots</strong>.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-198"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure198.png"
  alt="Example – Results Summary Plots – Iteration Plots Tab"
  caption="Example – Results Summary Plots – Iteration Plots Tab"
/>

The expandable <strong>Filter</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-194" />) contains three categories: <strong>Simulations</strong>,
<strong>Imminent</strong> <strong>Hazard</strong> <strong>Times</strong>, and <strong>Alternatives</strong>; for limiting the simulation results
displayed in the plot window by aggregated summary zones. Remove simulations from the plot window by unchecking the  checkbox for the aggregated
summary zone. For the example provided in in <FigReference figKey="figure-193" />, the results of the <em><strong>EPZ_Sensitivity</strong></em>
simulation and <em><strong>14:00</strong></em> imminent hazard time has been removed from results displayed in the plot window.

In the Simulations category (<FigReference figKey="figure-194" />), the simulations contain aggregation summary zones. For the example provided in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-194" />, the EPZ and Structure Name are aggregation summary zones for the EPZ_Sensitivity_Analysis simulation. All
fields in the summary zone, e.g., Toccoa_Falls and Unassigned in <FigReference figKey="figure-194" />) are listed to allow specific fields to be
filtered from the plot window. The aggregation summary zones listed for a simulation depends on the summary polygons defined for a simulation from the
 Create New Simulation dialog box (review [Create a Simulation](./14-simulations.mdx#create-a-simulation) for more information regarding the setup for
 a simulation).

Uncheck the  checkbox to turn off the <strong>Aggregate</strong> <strong>Selected</strong> <strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Zones</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-194" />) to display the results for all fields in the summary zone individually by not grouping the simulation
results by summary zone.

{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-0562f01d.png" /> button orders all series based on
 the range of values from high to low.

#### Iteration Plots Tab

In addition to the <strong>Simulation Results By Iteration</strong> and <strong>Filter</strong> panels (<FigReference figKey="figure-201" />), the
<strong>Iteration Plots</strong> tab contains a panel at the bottom of the plot window. The panel provides a <strong>Simulation</strong>,
<strong>Alternative</strong>, <strong>Imminent</strong> <strong>Hazard</strong> dropdown lists; an <strong>Iteration</strong> box and a
<strong>Generate</strong> <strong>Detail</strong> button (<FigReference figKey="figure-201" />). The purpose of the panel is to allow users to set
the simulation, alternative, and imminent hazard to display in the plot. Then from the combined selection users can visualize each iteration result in
 a scatter plot to help the user identify which iterations calculated outlying values (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration Number: 90</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-201" />). These outlying values, or any iteration of interest, can then be selected to generate detailed output for
 that specific iteration, by clicking the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ea6edc69.png" /> <strong>Generate Detail</strong>
button (<FigReference figKey="figure-201" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-204"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure204.png"
  alt="Clear Existing Message Dialog Box"
  caption="Clear Existing Message Dialog Box"
/>

If detailed output is generated, LifeSim re-runs the specified iteration with the same random number sequence but this time much more information is
saved. The detailed output generated contains information down to the evacuating group level regarding group size, location, and timing information
during the simulation. The detailed output generated includes a database containing evacuation information for groups and their evacuation paths,
structure inventory results shapefile, and a road network results shapefile. There is no limit to the number of iterations that LifeSim can generate a
 detailed output for, however physical memory could become an issue at some point. Detailed outputs cannot be generated concurrently.

The <strong>Re-Generate Detailed Output</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-6ba696c0.png" /> option re-generates the specified
 iteration's detailed output and is only available after a detailed output has been generated for a selected iteration. The <strong>Re-Generate
Detailed Output</strong> option is best used when the simulation has been altered and a detailed output had already been created for specific
iteration(s) and would need to be re-generated for the new simulation.

Refer to [View Detailed Output Results](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#view-detailed-output-results), [Detailed Output
Results](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#detailed-output-results) and [View Result Map in the Map
Window](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#view-result-map-in-the-map-window) for more information on viewing the results of the generated detailed
output for iterations.

### Simulation Result Table

The Simulation Result Table (<FigReference figKey="figure-189" />), Study Tree | Simulations shortcut menu command opens the Results Summary Tables (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-202" />). The Results Summary Tables (<FigReference figKey="figure-202" />) is divided into three main panels. The
 first panel located at the top left, is the Simulation Results By Iteration panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-202" />). The second panel located
at the bottom left, is the Simulation Results By Structure panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-202" />). The third panel located on the right-side is
 the table containing the Export and Copy Tools and Selection Tools toolbars (<FigReference figKey="figure-202" />). Refer to [Table
Tools](./05-lifesim-interface.mdx#table-tools) more information regarding the table toolbars.

#### Results Summary Tables Options

The expandable <strong>Filter</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-203" />) contains three categories: <strong>Simulations</strong>,
<strong>Imminent</strong> <strong>Hazard</strong> <strong>Times</strong>, and <strong>Alternatives</strong>; for limiting the simulation results
displayed in the table by aggregated summary zones. Remove simulations simulation aggregation zones, imminent hazard times, and/or alternatives from
the table by unchecking the  checkbox.

In the Simulations category (<FigReference figKey="figure-203" />), the simulations contain aggregation summary zones. For the example provided in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-203" />, the EPZ is the aggregation summary zone for the Indirect_AgDamages simulation. All fields in the summary
zone, e.g., Decatur, Henderson and Unassigned in <FigReference figKey="figure-203" />) are listed to allow specific fields to be filtered from the
table. The aggregation summary zones listed for a simulation depends on the summary polygons defined for a simulation from the Create New Simulation
dialog box (review [Create a Simulation](./14-simulations.mdx#create-a-simulation) for more information regarding the setup for a simulation).

Uncheck the  checkbox to turn off the <strong>Aggregate</strong> <strong>Selected</strong> <strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Zones</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-194" />) to display the results for all fields in the summary zone individually by not grouping the simulation
results by summary zone.

  caption="Example – Expression Dialog – Simulation Results Table – Structure Hydraulics"
/>

The panel provides the following dropdown lists for summarizing the results in the plot window:

- Summary Polygon – The dropdown list for this summary option contains a list of all summary zones listed for the simulation. The Summary Polygon (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-208" />) list is based on the summary polygons defined for the simulation from the Create New Simulation dialog box
 (review [Create a Simulation](./14-simulations.mdx#create-a-simulation) for more information regarding the setup for a simulation). Use the Summary
Polygon (<FigReference figKey="figure-208" />) list to select a specific summary zone.

- <strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Zones</strong> – The dropdown list for this option contains the list of polygon zone names in the selected
<strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Polygon</strong>. Select specific zone(s) by checking the checkbox  for the zone(s), from the
<strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Zone</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-208" />) list, to view the results for one or more areas in the study.
Alternatively, select <em><strong>All</strong></em><em> </em><em><strong>Zones</strong></em> (default) to view results for all zones in the summary
polygon.

- <strong>Plot</strong> <strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Data</strong> <strong>By</strong> – This dropdown menu contains a list of plot summary
options grouped by <strong>Life</strong> <strong>Loss</strong>, <strong>Percentage</strong> and <strong>Economic</strong> <strong>Damage</strong>
categories (<FigReference figKey="figure-208" />). The Simulation Results Whisker Plot updates the y-axis based on the <strong>Plot</strong>
<strong>Summary</strong> <strong>Data</strong> <strong>By</strong> selection (e.g., <em><strong>Total Life Loss</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-208" />).

### Time of Day Box and Whisker

By default, the <strong>Simulation</strong> <strong>Results</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-207" />) opens to the
<strong>Box and Whisker – Time of Day</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-207" />). The left side of the plot window provides an
<strong>Alternative</strong> <strong>Results</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-207" />) containing a list of the alternative names
included in the simulation. To view the results for specific alternative(s) in the simulation, check the checkbox(es)  for the desired alternative(s).
 By default, the <strong>Select</strong> <strong>All</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-207" />) checkbox is checked  to display all alternative
results in the <strong>Simulation Results Whisker Plot</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-207" />).

  alt="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Box and Whisker – Time of Day Tab"
  caption="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Box and Whisker – Time of Day Tab"
/>

The <strong>Alternatives</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />) contains a list of the alternative names included in the simulation.
To view the results for specific alternatives in the simulation, check the checkboxes  for the desired alternatives. By default, the
<strong>Alternatives</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />) checkbox is checked  to display all alternative results in the plot.

The Imminent Hazard Time panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />) contains a list of all of the hazard occurrence time(s) of day selected from
the Create New Simulation dialog box for the simulation (review [Create a Simulation](./14-simulations.mdx#create-a-simulation) for more information
regarding the setup for a simulation). By default, the Imminent Hazard Time (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />) checkbox is checked  to display
all time(s) of day in the plot.

In addition to the Alternatives and Imminent Hazard Time panels (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />), the Box and Whisker – Alternatives tab
contains a panel at the bottom of the plot window. The panel provides a Summary Polygon, Summary Zones, Plot Summary Data By dropdown lists (review
[Summarize Plot Results Options](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#summarize-plot-results-options)). The purpose of the panel is to allow users to set
the summary polygon, zones, and data to display in the plot.

### Results by Iteration

From the <strong>Simulation</strong> <strong>Results</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />), select the
<strong>Iterations</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />). Viewing results by iteration allows the user to visualize each iteration
result in a scatter plot to help the user identify which iterations calculated outlying values. These outlying values, or any iteration of interest,
can then be selected to generate detailed output for that specific iteration.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-213"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure213.png"
  alt="Example – Simulation Results Plots – Plot Summary Data By Options"
  caption="Example – Simulation Results Plots – Plot Summary Data By Options"
/>

The left side of the plot window provides the <strong>Alternatives</strong> and <strong>Imminent Hazard Time</strong> panels (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />). The <strong>Alternatives</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />) contains a list of the
alternative names included in the simulation. To view the results for specific alternatives in the simulation, check the checkboxes  for the desired
alternatives. By default, the <strong>Alternatives</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />) checkbox is checked  to display all alternative
results in the plot.

The Imminent Hazard Time panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />) contains a list of all of the hazard occurrence time(s) of day selected from
the Create New Simulation dialog box for the simulation (review [Create a Simulation](./14-simulations.mdx#create-a-simulation) for more information
regarding the setup for a simulation). By default, the Imminent Hazard Time (<FigReference figKey="figure-209" />) checkbox is checked  to display
all time(s) of day in the plot.

In addition to the Alternatives and Imminent Hazard Time panels (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />), the Iterations tab contains a panel at the
bottom of the plot window. The panel provides a Summary Polygon, Summary Zones, Plot Summary Data By dropdown lists (review [Summarize Plot Results
Options](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#summarize-plot-results-options)). The purpose of the panel is to allow users to set the summary polygon,
zones, and data to display in the plot.

#### Detailed Output

Within the <strong>Simulation Results Iteration Plot</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />), the <strong>Iterations</strong> tab contains an
 <strong>Alternative</strong> dropdown list, an <strong>Iteration</strong> box and a <strong>Generate</strong> <strong>Detailed Output</strong> button
 (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />). The purpose of the detailed output panel is to allow users to identify iterations that calculated outlying
values (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration Number: 56</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-210" />). These outlying values, or any iteration of
interest, can be selected to generate detailed output for that specific iteration, by clicking the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ea6edc69.png" /> <strong>Generate Detailed
Output</strong> button (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />).

If detailed output is generated, LifeSim re-runs the specified iteration with the same random number sequence but this time much more information is
saved. The detailed output generated contains information down to the evacuating group level regarding group size, location, and timing information
during the simulation. The detailed output generated includes a database containing evacuation information for groups and their evacuation paths,
structure inventory results shapefile, and a road network results shapefile. There is no limit to the number of iterations that LifeSim can generate a
 detailed output for, however physical memory could become an issue at some point. Detailed outputs cannot be generated concurrently.

The <strong>Re-Generate Detailed Output</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-6ba696c0.png" /> option re-generates the specified
 iteration's detailed output and is only available after a detailed output has been generated for a selected iteration. The <strong>Re-Generate
Detailed Output</strong> option is best used when the simulation has been altered and a detailed output had already been created for specific
iteration(s) and would need to be re-generated for the new simulation.

Refer to [View Detailed Output Results](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#view-detailed-output-results), [Detailed Output
Results](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#detailed-output-results) and [View Result Map in the Map
Window](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#view-result-map-in-the-map-window)  for more information on viewing the results of the generated detailed
output for iterations.

### Warning and Mobilization Uncertainty

From the <strong>Simulation</strong> <strong>Results</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />), select the
<strong>Warning and Mobilization Uncertainty</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />). This tab allows the user to visualize the results
of the sampled uncertainty to quickly identify parameters that are driving the consequences. For example, plotting by warning issuance could show a
strong trend between when the warning is issued and the total life loss. These results can be extremely helpful in identifying alternatives for risk
reduction measures.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-214"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure214.png"
  alt="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Box and Whisker – Alternatives Tab"
  caption="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Box and Whisker – Alternatives Tab"
/>

The left side of the <strong>Warning and Mobilization Uncertainty</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) provides an
<strong>Alternative</strong> <strong>Results</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) containing a list of the alternative names
included in the simulation. By default, the <strong>Select</strong> <strong>All</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) checkbox is checked
to display all alternative results in the plot. Each alternative listed in the <strong>Alternative</strong> <strong>Results</strong> panel (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) contains the time(s) of day and zones. To expand the alternative, click ; to collapse the alternative,
click  (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />).

Include a time of day by checking the checkbox  (e.g., <em><strong>02:00</strong></em> and <em><strong>14:00</strong></em> are selected in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />). Remove a time of day from the plot by unchecking  the checkbox. Include specific zones in the plot by
selecting the zone name(s). For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-211" />, for both <em><strong>02:00</strong></em> and
<em><strong>14:00</strong></em>, <em><strong>Henderson</strong></em> is selected, but <em><strong>Decatur</strong></em> is not selected; therefore,
only the results from <em><strong>Henderson</strong></em> is displayed in the plot.

#### Sampled Parameter Options

Within the <strong>Simulation Results Uncertainty Plot</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />), the <strong>Sampled Parameter</strong> list (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />), allows the user to summarize results by various parameters. From the <strong>Sampled Parameter</strong>
list (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />), users can select different parameters for viewing data in the plot. By default, the <strong>Relative
Warning Issuance</strong> option is selected from the <strong>Sampled Parameter</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) and displayed in
 the plot. For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-211" />, the <strong>Hazard Communication Delay</strong> option (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) is selected and displayed in the plot.

For the <strong>Mobilization Curve</strong> and <strong>Warning Dissemination Curve</strong> options, the X-axis represents the sample that was used
to define the curve. A value of zero would mean the curve was sampled at the lower bound of the uncertainty and a value of one would mean that the
curve was sampled at the upper bound. For example, if the PAI curve maximum % initiated for an EPZ ranged between 85 and 95 percent and the X-axis
value was zero, then the iteration had a maximum % initiated of 85 percent of the population for the EPZ.

#### Detailed Output

A panel located at the bottom of the <strong>Simulation Results Uncertainty Plot</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) contains an
<strong>Alternative</strong> dropdown list, an <strong>Iteration</strong> box and a <strong>Generate</strong> <strong>Detailed Output</strong> button
(<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />). The purpose of the detailed output panel is to allow users to identify iterations that calculated outlying
values (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration Number: 25</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-211" />). These outlying values, or any iteration of
interest, can be selected to generate detailed output for that specific iteration, by clicking the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-ea6edc69.png" /> <strong>Generate Detailed
Output</strong> button (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />).

If detailed output is generated, LifeSim re-runs the specified iteration with the same random number sequence but this time much more information is
saved. The detailed output generated contains information down to the evacuating group level regarding group size, location, and timing information
during the simulation. The detailed output generated includes a database containing evacuation information for groups and their evacuation paths,
structure inventory results shapefile, and a road network results shapefile. There is no limit to the number of iterations that LifeSim can generate a
 detailed output for, however physical memory could become an issue at some point. Detailed outputs cannot be generated concurrently.

The <strong>Re-Generate Detailed Output</strong>
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-6ba696c0.png" /> option (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-211" />) re-generates the specified iteration's detailed output and is only available after a detailed output has
been generated for a selected iteration. The <strong>Re-Generate Detailed Output</strong> option is best used when the simulation has been altered and
 a detailed output had already been created for specific iteration(s) and would need to be re-generated for the new simulation.

Refer to [View Detailed Output Results](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#view-detailed-output-results), [Detailed Output
Results](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#detailed-output-results) and [View Result Map in the Map
Window](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#view-result-map-in-the-map-window) for more information on viewing the results of the generated detailed
output for iterations.

### View Detailed Output Results

When more information is desired for a specific iteration, detailed output can be generated. If detailed output is generated, LifeSim re-runs the
specified iteration with the same random number sequence but this time much more information is saved. The detailed output generated contains
information down to the evacuating group level regarding group size, location, and timing information during the simulation. The detailed output
generated includes a database containing evacuation information for groups and their evacuation paths, structure inventory results shapefile, and a
road network results shapefile. There is no limit to the number of iterations that LifeSim can generate a detailed output for, however physical memory
 could become an issue at some point. Detailed outputs cannot be generated concurrently.

From the <strong>Simulation</strong> <strong>Results</strong> <strong>Plots</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-210" />), select the
<strong>Detailed Output Results</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />). This tab allows the user to visualize the detailed output
results generated for specific iterations of interest. The left side of the <strong>Detailed Output Results</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />) provides a <strong>Detailed Evacuation Results</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />)
containing a list of all iterations with detailed output results. The iterations are grouped by alternative name and time of day.

To view the results for an iteration, from the <strong>Detailed Evacuation Results</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />), select the
desired iteration (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration : ‘97’ – 02:00 Hazard</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-212" />). The
<strong>Time</strong> <strong>Evacuating</strong> <strong>Histogram</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />), <strong>Cumulative</strong>
<strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Outflow</strong>, and <strong>Cumulative</strong> <strong>Destination</strong> <strong>Arrivals</strong> tabs
display the results for the selected iteration.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-215"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure215.png"
  alt="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Iterations Tab"
  caption="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Iterations Tab"
/>

#### Time Evacuating Histogram Tab

By default, the <strong>Detailed Output Results</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />) opens to the <strong>Time</strong>
<strong>Evacuating</strong> <strong>Histogram</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />) tab. The time evacuating histogram, for the results of
the iteration selected (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration : ‘97’ – 02:00 Hazard</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-212" />), gives the user an
indication for how long it takes groups to evacuate to a destination. This data is gathered from the detailed output table (review Detailed Output
Results](#detailed-output-results)) as the difference between <strong>TimeEnded</strong> and <strong>TimeMobilized</strong>.

#### Cumulative Evacuation Outflow Tab

From the <strong>Detailed Output Results</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />), select the <strong>Cumulative</strong>
<strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Outflow</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-213" />). The evacuation outflow plot displays the cumulative
flow of people that mobilize and reach safety over time. The plot can act as a good indicator of traffic congestion occurring during the evacuation.
If the "Reached Safety" curve deviates from the "Mobilized" curve, this is an indication that traffic congestion is occurring.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-216"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure216.png"
  alt="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Warning and Mobilization Uncertainty Tab – Sampled Parameter Options"
  caption="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Warning and Mobilization Uncertainty Tab – Sampled Parameter Options"
/>

#### Cumulative Destination Arrivals Tab

From the <strong>Detailed Output Results</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />), select the <strong>Cumulative</strong>
<strong>Destination</strong> <strong>Arrivals</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-214" />). The cumulative destination outflow plot shows
cumulative curves for the arrival of vehicles to each destination in the study.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-217"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure217.png"
  alt="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Detailed Output Results Tab – Time Evacuating Histogram Tab"
  caption="Example – Simulation ‘ALL’ Results Plots – Detailed Output Results Tab – Time Evacuating Histogram Tab"
/>

The plot can be very useful in checking the validity of the traffic simulation results. If a destination is showing significantly more outflow than
historical department of transportation data would indicate then the user should question the validity of the results and consider adjustments. If a
destination that should be getting significant through traffic is getting none then the user should check the road network to make sure the roads are
connected correctly (refer to [Appendix B](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#appendix-b-map-preferences) for tips on how to refine road network
connectivity). Another way to check would be to animate the evacuation process to see the area of concern.

### ECAM Results

From the Simulation Results Tables (<FigReference figKey="figure-219" />), select the ECAM Results tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-220" />). The
ECAM results are provided in two tables, the Employment Results, and the Production Results (<FigReference figKey="figure-220" />) tables by
alternative, county and ECAM sector. Note, the ECAM Results tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-220" />) is only available for simulations which
include at least one alternative with an ECAM dataset (review [Compute Options for an
Alternative](./13-alternatives.mdx#compute-options-for-an-alternative)).

### Detailed Output Results

From the <strong>Simulation Results Tables</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-215" />), select the <strong>Detailed Output Results</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />). This tab allows the user to visualize the detailed output results generated for specific iterations of
interest. The left side of the <strong>Detailed Output Results</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) provides a <strong>Detailed
Evacuation Group Results</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) containing a list of all iterations with detailed output results.

The iterations are grouped by alternative name and time of day. To expand the alternative, click ; to collapse the alternative, click  (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />). To view the results for an iteration, from the <strong>Detailed Evacuation Group Results</strong> panel (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />), select the desired iteration (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration : ‘97’ – 02:00 Hazard</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />).

<Figure

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure224.png"
  alt="Example – Simulation Results Tables – Agriculture Results Tab"
  caption="Example – Simulation Results Tables – Agriculture Results Tab"
/>

The functionality of the table is the same as the summary results table ([Simulation Results
Table](./15-viewing-lifesim-results.mdx#simulation-results-table)). The detailed output table contains information about each evacuating group’s
behaviors during the iteration such as their origin, when they received the warning, when they mobilized, and where they evacuated to. This table can
be very useful for finding specific information (e.g., the number of groups or people that did not get warned prior to getting trapped in their
structure). The timing values for warning, mobilized, and ended are all relative to the imminent hazard time.

For every group that was defined for the iteration the detailed output table (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) contains the number of people,
their origin (coincides with row number in structure attribute table), their destination (-1 means no destination was reached), warning information,
mobilization information, and if they were caught evacuating.

## Simulation Results in Map Window

Open the simulation results maps for a simulation, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-191" />), from the
<strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, under <strong>Simulations</strong>, right-click on a simulation (e.g.,
<em><strong>EMB Spill + 1FT</strong></em>), from the shortcut menu click <strong>View Results Maps</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-191" />).
The <strong>Result Map Selector</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-215" />) opens for the alternatives associated with the simulation.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-225"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure225.png"
  alt="Example – Simulation Results Tables – ECAM Results Tab"
  caption="Example – Simulation Results Tables – ECAM Results Tab"
/>

The left side of the <strong>Result Map Selector</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) provides an <strong>Alternative</strong>
<strong>Results</strong> panel containing a list of the alternative names included in the simulation. Each alternative listed in the
<strong>Alternative</strong> <strong>Results</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) contains the time(s) of day and results source
(e.g., hydraulic data, roads summary, structure summary).

To expand the alternative, click ; to collapse the alternative, click  (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />). Include alternative results selection
by checking the checkbox  (e.g., <em><strong>Hydraulics 02:00 NF SPILL + 1FT</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-221" />). Uncheck  the
checkbox for an alternative result to exclude the results. Selected results are added to the map window when the <strong>Send Selected To Map
Window</strong> button (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) is clicked.

The panel on the right side of the Result Map Selector dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) displays the default color scheme defined
for the selected alternative results. Users can modify the default color scheme by clicking the checkbox  to Change default color scheme (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />). For more information regarding modifying the color scheme and drawing style, review [Feature Draw
Properties Tab](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#feature-draw-properties-tab).

NOTE: The roads and/or structure summary data is only included in the Alternative Results panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) if the
simulation was set to Generate Structure Summary Results and/or Generate Road Summary Results, from the Create New Simulation dialog box for the
simulation (review [Simulation – Computation Engine Options](./14-simulations.mdx#simulation-computation-engine-options) for more information
regarding the setup for a simulation). Furthermore, when detailed output results are generated for iterations, then the detailed output results
(evacuation animation, road details and structure details) display in the Alternative Results panel (e.g., Iteration 97 in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-223" />), and iterations are grouped by alternative name and time of day.

### Color Scheme Options

The <strong>Result Map Selector</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />) provides a default color scheme for the alternative
results source (e.g., hydraulic data, roads summary, structure summary) listed in the <strong>Alternative</strong> <strong>Results</strong> panel (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-221" />). For the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-224" />, the hydraulic depth grid default color
 scheme is a continuous color ramp ranging from light blue to deep blue to identify hydraulic depths from shallow to deep.

To modify the default color scheme for a specific alternative result, from the Alternative Results panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-224" />),
select the desired results (e.g., Hydraulics 02:00 EMB FAIL SPILL + 1FT_2_2d_5s in <FigReference figKey="figure-224" />). Check the checkbox  to
Change default color scheme (<FigReference figKey="figure-224" />). The feature draw properties can now be modified for any results selected from the
 Alternative Results panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-224" />). For more information regarding modifying the color scheme and drawing style,
review [Feature Draw Properties Tab](./18-appendix-map-preferences.mdx#feature-draw-properties-tab).

### View Result Map in the Map Window

To view any of the alternative results in the map window, from the <strong>Alternative</strong> <strong>Results</strong> panel (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-224" />), check the checkbox  for the results of interest (e.g., <em><strong>Hydraulics 02:00 EMB FAIL SPILL +
1FT_2_2d_5s</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-224" />), and click <strong>Send Selected To Map Window</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-224" />). The <strong>Result Map Selector</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-224" />) closes and
the selected alternative results are added to the <strong>Map</strong> <strong>Layers</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-225" />) and display
 in the map window.

#### Road and Structure Details

The road and structure summary or detailed output can be viewed for an iteration (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration 97 Road Details</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-225" />) or an alternative (e.g., <em><strong>EMB Spill + 1FT Fail – Minimal Structure Summary</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-225" />) from the map window. The road and structure information added to the map window for the detailed output
displays life loss total (i.e., <em>Life_Loss_Total</em>) that occurred inside each structure or on each road segment and is color-coded and changes
by size. For example, an increasing loss of life in a structure there is an increasing icon size and gray to red coloration. This output can be very
useful for viewing the entire study area and highlight areas with the greatest risk for life loss in structures or on roads which require
supplementary investigation.

#### Animate Alternative Results

Hydraulic results and detailed output results for iterations can be reviewed as an animation in the map window. The detailed output animation provides
 a dynamic view for the results of the iteration number selected (e.g., <em><strong>Iteration 97</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-225" />
). The animation results can be used to review evacuation routes, warning issuance times, hydraulic data, and other simulation items. The animations
can also be exported as video files to share. The map window displays an animation playback control in the animation toolbar (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-226" />), which functions similarly to video controls for viewing the animation results in the map window.

The animation toolbar controls the evacuation animation and the hydraulic animation. To edit the animation speed, or animation window start and stop
time, from the animation toolbar, click <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-e15a09d0.png" />
 to open the <strong>Animation</strong> <strong>Settings</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-226" />). From the
<strong>Animation</strong> <strong>Settings</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-226" />), set the animation window start time and end
time and the slider settings. Click <strong>OK</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-226" />) to apply the animation settings to the animation
playback and close the <strong>Animation</strong> <strong>Settings</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-226" />).

To export the animations as a video file to share, from the animation toolbar, from the animation toolbar, click
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-7d61ee23.png" /> to open the
<strong>Export</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> <strong>Wizard</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-226" />). From the
<strong>Export</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> <strong>Wizard</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-226" />), identify the
<strong>Output</strong> <strong>File</strong> location and file name, the start and end animation window, the timer position and frame rate for the exported
 file. Click <strong>OK</strong> to create the video.
