# Hydraulic Data

<strong>Hydraulic data</strong> is a critical component to computing life loss in LifeSim. Hydraulic data sources in LifeSim generally come from a
two-dimensional hydraulic model, such as HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's (HEC) River Analysis System software), FLO-2D (FLO-2D Software,
Inc., Nutrioso, AZ), or MIKE 21 (Danish Hydraulic Institute, Denmark (DHI), see Appendix C). New to LifeSim Version 2.0, hydraulic data can also be imported
 from USACE Engineer Research and Development Center’s (ERDC) Adaptive Hydraulics Model (ADH) system (see Appendix C). Also new to LifeSim 2.0 is the
ability to import summary grids. LifeSim will interpolate the depths and velocities between hydraulic time steps. A shorter hydraulic time step will
generally provide more hydraulically accurate computations.

In addition to providing the time series of depth and velocity, if life loss is being assessed then a hydrograph representing the hydraulic event must
 be provided as well. The hydrograph is critical in developing the warning issuance timing relative to a specific condition (e.g., dam or levee
breach). This chapter covers the various ways to import, edit, and view hydraulic data.

## Hydraulic Data Import Options

The four available options to import hydraulic data in LifeSim Version 2.0 are from HEC-RAS (*.pXX.hdf or *.hdf) files, FLO-2D files, gridded data
(*.) files for depth and velocity, and summary grids (new to LifeSim Version 2.0). Open any of the hydraulic data import options, from the LifeSim
main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>, right-click on
<strong>Hydraulic</strong> <strong>Data</strong>, to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />). Another way is from the LifeSim
main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-30" />), and select the
desired import option.

The import dialog for each hydraulic source contains the same general structure. The top portion of the hydraulic data import dialogs provide browser
buttons for selecting the source file(s) and the bottom portion of the import dialog contains the <strong>Hydrograph</strong>
<strong>Definition</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-31" />). Depending on the hydraulic data importer the hydrograph definition panel
provides two of three buttons as identified in <TableReference tableKey="table-2" />.

### Import from HEC-RAS

LifeSim has the ability to import hydraulic results directly from an HEC-RAS study as long as the HEC-RAS results were produced with HEC-RAS Version
5.0 or later. The ability to link directly with the hydraulic results, and convert the hydraulic information, is an efficient step in creating
hydraulic data for an LifeSim study. LifeSim uses the HEC-RAS RASMapper.dll library to sample hydraulic information and create layers that can be
viewed in the map window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />).

Creating hydraulic data from an HEC-RAS study:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />) from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Hydraulic</strong> <strong>Data</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Import From HEC-RAS</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />). Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to
<strong>Hydraulic Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-30" />), click <strong>Import From HEC-RAS</strong>.

1. Either way, the <strong>Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later)</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-31" />) opens.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-31"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure31.png"
  alt="Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) Dialog Box"
  caption="Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) Dialog Box"
/>

1. To select the HEC-RAS output file, from the <strong>RAS Output Set Files Directory</strong> box click , an <strong>Open Directory Containing RAS
Output</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) will open. Navigate to the location of an HEC-RAS plan output files; select the correct
 HEC-RAS plan output folder. The selected folder should contain the output files with the file extension <em>&#42;.hdf</em>. Click <strong>Select
Folder</strong>, the <strong>Open Directory Containing RAS Output</strong> browser closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) and the user is returned
 to the <strong>Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later)</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-34" />). Note, if the wrong folder is selected
then the <strong>HEC-RAS Output File</strong> dropdown menu will be empty.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-32"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure32.png"
  alt="Open Directory Containing RAS Output Browser"
  caption="Open Directory Containing RAS Output Browser"
/>

<Figure
  figKey="figure-33"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure33.png"
  alt="Open Browser – Select RAS HDF5 File"
  caption="Open Browser – Select RAS HDF5 File"
/>

The <strong>RAS Output Set Files Directory</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />) updates with the location and the name of the HEC-RAS
plan output file folder. Also, if there is an associated terrain file in the same location, then the <strong>HEC-RAS Terrain File
(</strong><em><strong>&#42;.hdf</strong></em><strong>)</strong> box will be automatically populated.

1. Select the desired HEC-RAS file from the <strong>HEC-RAS Output File</strong> dropdown (<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />) which contains the
names of the HEC-RAS plan output files contained in the selected HEC-RAS output directory. By default, the name of the HEC-RAS plan output file is
used as the name of the hydraulic dataset. The name appears in the <strong>Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />), the user can
change the default name.

1. If the HEC-RAS terrain file is not located in the same place as the HEC-RAS plan output files, to the right of the <strong>HEC-RAS Terrain File
(</strong><em><strong>.hdf</strong></em><strong>)</strong> box click . An <strong>Open</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) opens,
navigate to the directory where the terrain file is located. Select the correct terrain file (e.g., <em>&#42;.hdf</em>), click <strong>Open</strong>, the
<strong>Open</strong> browser closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) and the <strong>Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later)</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />) updates with the selected file.

1. Next, the user can import the representative hydrograph (time series). Depending on the HEC-RAS output results file two options are available for
selecting a representative hydrograph. The first option, Import From RAS, only works for HEC-RAS Version 5.0 and later output files (review [Import from
 RAS](#import-from-ras)). The second option, Import From Map only works for HEC-RAS Version 5.0 output files (review [Import From
Map](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#import-from-map)). The representative hydrograph can be created from a cross section location or a storage area location.
 Users can also add the representative hydrograph manually (review [Create Hydrograph Manually](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#create-hydrograph-manually)).

1. The Hazard Occurrence information need to be defined, [First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard
Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence) provides further details. Note, the first hydraulic timestep is
defined by the model output for only hydraulic data imported from the Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />) option.

1. Once all the data required to build a hydraulic dataset from HEC-RAS has been completed click <strong>OK</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-34"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure34.png"
  alt="Example – Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) Dialog Box – Completed"
  caption="Example – Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) Dialog Box – Completed"
/>

1. The <strong>Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later)</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />) closes, a <strong>Progress</strong>
<strong>Window</strong> opens displaying the progress of the import and once complete the hydraulic data is added to the study and displays in the
<strong>Study Tree</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />), under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>.

### Import from FLO-2D

LifeSim has the ability to import hydraulic results directly from FLO-2D output files. The required FLO-2D output files are DEPTH.OUT and TIMDEP.OUT
which can be generated automatically from a FLO-2D simulation. LifeSim will take the FLO-2D results files and convert them into a time series of depth
 and velocity compressed geotiff files. The geotiff files are stored in the hydraulics directory of the LifeSim study. The ability to link directly
with the hydraulic results saves a huge step in converting hydraulic information to a software specific format.

To import hydraulic data, from FLO-2D, to an existing LifeSim study:

1.  From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Hydraulic</strong> <strong>Data</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Import From FLO2D</strong>. Another way is from
the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-30" />), and
click <strong>Import From FLO2D</strong>.

1. From either way, the <strong>Import From FLO2D</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-35" />) opens. In the <strong>Name</strong> box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-35" />), enter a name for the hydraulic data.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-35"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure35.png"
  alt="Import From FLO2D Dialog Box"
  caption="Import From FLO2D Dialog Box"
/>

1. In the <strong>DEPTH.OUT File</strong> box click , an <strong>Open</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) will open. Navigate to
the directory where the hydraulic data (<strong>DEPTH.OUT</strong>) for the FLO-2D model is located. Select the correct FLO-2D output file (e.g.,
<em>&#42;.OUT</em>). Click <strong>Open</strong>, the <strong>Open</strong> browser closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />), and the <strong>Import
From FLO2D</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-36" />) updates to display the selected file location in the <strong>DEPTH.OUT
File</strong> box.

1. If the FLO-2D depth file (DEPTH.OUT) is not located in the same directory as the time of depth file (TIMDEP.OUT), to right of the
<strong>TIMDEP.OUT File</strong> box click , an <strong>Open</strong> browser will open (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />). Navigate to the
directory where the hydraulic file (<strong>TIMDEP.OUT</strong>) is located, select the file (<em>&#42;.OUT)</em>. Click <strong>Open</strong>, the
<strong>Open</strong> browser closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />), and the <strong>Import From FLO2D</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-36" />) updates to display the selected file location in the <strong>TIMEDEP.OUT File</strong> box.

<Figure

  alt="Import From FLO2D Dialog – Example Selected Time Series Data"
  caption="Import From FLO2D Dialog – Example Selected Time Series Data"
/>

1. The <strong>Projection </strong>box is available for selecting the geographic projection for the FLO-2D hydraulic data to be imported using an
Esri<sup>®</sup>'s projection file format. The user may add the geographic projection by clicking , an <strong>Open</strong> browser will open (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />). Navigate to the location of the projection file<em> (&#42;.prj)</em>, click <strong>Open</strong>, the
<strong>Open</strong> browser closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) and updates the <strong>Import From FLO2D</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-36" />) to display the selected projection file in the <strong>Projection </strong>box.

1. Set the vertical units for the hydraulic data (either <strong>US Customary</strong> or <strong>System International</strong>) from the
<strong>Vertical Units</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-36" />).

1. Next, enter the representative hydrograph (time series). Users can enter the representative hydrograph manually (review [Create Hydrograph
Manually](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#create-hydrograph-manually)).

1. The First Hydraulic Timestep and the Hazard Occurrence information needs to be defined next, refer to [First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard
Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence) for further details.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Import From FLO2D</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-36" />) closes. The hydraulic data is
added to the study and displays in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />), under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>.

### Import from Grid Set

LifeSim has the ability to import hydraulic results (e.g., MIKE.21, DHI) directly from a time series of gridded files (grid set). Most hydraulic
simulation engines can store depth and velocity grids as time series, which is an easy and convenient way to transfer hydraulic simulation data among various
 groups that may not have the hydraulic modeling software. LifeSim can import depth and velocity grids in several formats: <em>&#42;.flt</em>,
<em>&#42;.tif</em>, and binary Esri<sup>®</sup> grids. When importing a grid set, LifeSim converts the gridded data into geotiff files which are stored in
 the hydraulics study directory.

To import hydraulic data, in a gridded format, to an existing LifeSim study:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Hydraulic</strong> <strong>Data</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Import From Grids</strong>. Another way is from
the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-30" />), and
click <strong>Import From Grid Set</strong>. Either way, the <strong>Import From Grid Set</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-37" />)
opens.

1. In the <strong>Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-37" />), enter a name for the hydraulic gridded data.

1. To the right of the <strong>Grid Set Files Directory</strong> box click , an <strong>Open Directory Containing grids</strong> browser opens (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-38" />). Navigate to the folder where the hydraulic grid data is located, select the correct folder, click
<strong>Select Folder</strong>. The <strong>Open</strong> <strong>Directory Containing grids</strong> browser closes (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-38" />), and the <strong>Import From Grid Set</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-39" />) updates to
 display the selected folder in the <strong>Grid Set Files Directory</strong> box.

1. Next, if the depth grids are spaced at regular time intervals and are in a specific naming convention and numerical order, click <strong>Grids are
in numeric order with the first depth grid = dp1 or dp001 and velocity = vp1 or vp001</strong>. Only select this option, if the <strong>Grid Set
Timestep (minutes)</strong> is the same between each grid and the grids follow the specified naming convention of "depth grids being dp# and velocity
grids being vp#" where # is 1 or 001 for the first grid and incrementing by one for each subsequent timestep. Enter the time interval separating the
grids in the <strong>Grid Set Timestep (minunte)</strong> box.

1. If the gridded files do not satisfy the regular interval naming format, do not select <strong>Grids are in numeric order with the first depth grid
= dp1 or dp001 and velocity = vp1 or vp001</strong> and the <strong>Grid</strong> <strong>Set</strong> <strong>Timestep</strong>
(<strong>minutes</strong>) box will remain disabled (grayed out). The user then must enter the <strong>Depth</strong>, <strong>Velocity</strong> and
<strong>Time (hours)</strong> in the table. Click the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Row</strong> and <strong>Remove Row</strong> buttons to add a row
or remove a row in the <strong>Depth</strong>, <strong>Velocity</strong>, and <strong>Time (hours)</strong> table. Rows will always be either added or
 removed from the bottom of the table.

1. Next, the user can import the representative hydrograph (time series). The first option, Import From RAS, only works for HEC-RAS Version 5.0 and
later output files (review [Import from RAS](#import-from-ras)). The second option is to add the representative hydrograph manually (review [Create
Hydrograph Manually](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#create-hydrograph-manually)).

1. The First Hydraulic Timestep and the Hazard Occurrence information needs to be defined next, refer to [First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard
Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence) for further details.

1. Once all of the data has been entered click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Import From Grid Set</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-39" />) closes. The hydraulic data is added to the study and displays in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />), under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>.

### Import from AdH

New to Version 2.0, LifeSim has the ability to import hydraulic results from ERDC’s Adaptive Hydraulics (AdH) computational tool simulation output
files. LifeSim will take the AdH results files and convert them into a TIN mesh time series of depth and velocity. The TIN and time series data are
stored in the hydraulics directory of the LifeSim study. The ability to link directly with the hydraulic results saves a huge step in converting
hydraulic information to a software specific format.

To import hydraulic data, from AdH, to an existing LifeSim study:

1.  From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Hydraulic</strong> <strong>Data</strong>, from the shortcut menu click <strong>Import From AdH</strong>. Another way is from
the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-30" />), and
click <strong>Import From AdH</strong>.

1. From either way, the <strong>Import From AdH</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-40" />) opens. In the <strong>Name</strong> box (

Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence) for further details.

1. Once all of the data has been entered click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Import From AdH</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-42" />) closes. The hydraulic data is added to the study and displays in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />), under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>.

### Import from ADCIRC

New to Version 2.0, LifeSim has the ability to import hydraulic results from the University of North Carolina’s Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC)
simulation output files. LifeSim will take the ADCIRC results files and convert them into a TIN mesh time series of depth and velocity. The TIN and
time series data are stored in the hydraulics directory of the LifeSim study. The ability to link directly with the hydraulic results saves a huge
step in converting hydraulic information to a software specific format.

1. Next, add the representative hydrograph manually (review [Create Hydrograph Manually](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#create-hydrograph-manually)).

1. Define the First Hydraulic Timestep and the Hazard Occurrence information, refer to [First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard
Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence) for further details.

1. Once all of the data has been entered click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Import From ADCIRC</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-45" />) closes. The hydraulic data is added to the study and displays in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />), under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>.

### Import from Summary Grids

New to Version 2.0, LifeSim has the ability to import hydraulic data from summary grids (raster files). Importing summary grids bypasses the need for
LifeSim to calculate hydraulic characteristics. LifeSim can import summary grids in several formats: <em>&#42;.flt</em>, <em>&#42;.tif</em>, and
<em>&#42;.vrt</em>. The five hydraulic characteristics that can be represented by summary grids are maximum depth, maximum velocity, non-evacuation
arrival time, first-inundated arrival time, and duration inundated. Depending on the target consequence estimate (e.g., structure damages, life loss,
agricultural damages) specific hydraulic characteristics are required (<TableReference tableKey="table-3" />).

LifeSim stores imported summary grid files in the hydraulics study directory.

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure46.png"
  alt="Import From Summary Grids Dialog Box"
  caption="Import From Summary Grids Dialog Box"
/>

1. In the <strong>Name</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-46" />), enter a name for the hydraulic data.

1. To the right of the <strong>Maximum Depth Grid (Required)</strong> box click , an <strong>Open</strong> browser opens (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />). Navigate to the folder containing the hydraulic summary grid (*.tif, *.flt, or *.vrt), select the correct
file and file type (e.g., FLOAT File (*.flt)), and click <strong>Open</strong>. The <strong>Open</strong> browser closes (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-33" />), the <strong>Import From Summary Grids</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-47" />) displays
the selected file in the <strong>Maximum Depth Grid</strong> box.

1. Continue to select the desired summary grids to import by clicking the browse to  button, navigating to the desired summary grid, selecting the
grid and clicking <strong>Open</strong>. The <strong>Import From Summary Grids</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-47" />) displays the
 selected file.

1. Set the <strong>Vertical Units</strong> (either <strong>US Customary</strong>, feet, or <strong>System International (SI)</strong>, meters) for the
 hydraulic data (<FigReference figKey="figure-47" />).

1. If the summary grids selected include the Non-Evacuation Arrival and/or First-Inundated Arrival grids, then the <strong>Arrival Time Units</strong>
 is enabled. From the <strong>Arrival Time Units</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-47" />), select the correct units
(<strong>Seconds</strong>, <strong>Minutes</strong>, <strong>Hours</strong>, <strong>Days</strong>) for the selected arrival grids. If both
Non-Evacuation and First-Inundated grids are supplied, it will be assumed that they both have the same time units.

1. If a summary grid is selected for the Duration Inundated Grid, then <strong>Duration Time Units</strong> is enabled. From the <strong>Duration Time
 Units</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-47" />), select the correct units (<strong>Seconds</strong>, <strong>Minutes</strong>,
<strong>Hours</strong>, <strong>Days</strong>) for the selected arrival grids.

1. Next, create the representative hydrograph by clicking the Import From RAS (refer to [Import from RAS](#import-from-ras)) button, or by adding the
hydrograph time series manually (review [Create Hydrograph Manually](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#create-hydrograph-manually)).



<Figure

  alt="Import From Summary Grids – Completed Example"
  caption="Import From Summary Grids – Completed Example"
/>

1. Then define the Hazard Occurrence and the First Hydraulic Timestep information next, refer to [First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard
Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence) for further details.

1. Once all of the data has been entered in the <strong>Import From Summary Grids</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-47" />), click
<strong>OK</strong>. The <strong>Import From Summary Grids</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-47" />) closes. The hydraulic data is
added to the study and displays in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />), under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>.

## Representative Hydrograph

In addition to providing the time series of depth and velocity (review [Hydraulic Data Import Options]), a hydrograph representing the hydraulic event
 must be provided as well for performing life loss calculations. The representative hydrograph is critical in developing the warning issuance timing
relative to a specific condition (e.g., dam or levee breach). However, the hydrograph is for visualization purposes only and is not used in the
simulation engine. The representative hydrograph can be created by importing the hydrograph from HEC-RAS data, import from a map (created from the
HEC-RAS hydraulic data that has been imported), or by entering the hydrograph time series data manually.

### Import From RAS

The representative hydrograph can be created by importing the hydrograph from HEC-RAS data. Many of the hydraulic data import options described in
[Hydraulic Data Import Options], include the option to select the representative hydrograph from HEC-RAS Version 5.0 (and later) output data by
clicking the <strong>Import From RAS</strong> button (<FigReference figKey="figure-48" />) to open the <strong>RAS Results Selector</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-49" />) dialog box.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-48"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure48.png"
  alt="Example – Hydraulic Data Importer – Hydrograph Definition Panel"
  caption="Example – Hydraulic Data Importer – Hydrograph Definition Panel"
/>

<Figure
  figKey="figure-49"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure49.png"
  alt="RAS Results Selector Dialog Box"
  caption="RAS Results Selector Dialog Box"
/>

To select the representative hydrograph from HEC-RAS Version 5.0 results:

1. From the <strong>RAS Results File (</strong><em><strong>&#42;.pXX.hdf</strong></em><strong>)</strong> box click . An <strong>Open</strong> browser (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) opens, navigate to the directory where the HEC-RAS output file is located. Select the correct RAS results
file (<em>&#42;.pXX.hdf</em>), click <strong>Open</strong>, the <strong>Open</strong> browser will close (<FigReference figKey="figure-32" />) and the
selected file opens in the <strong>RAS Results Selector</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-49" />). The representative hydrograph can be created from
 a cross section location or a storage area location.

1. To create the representative hydrograph from an HEC-RAS cross section location, from the <strong>RAS Results Selector</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-49" />) dialog box, click
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-a8b9dd99.png" /> to expand the <strong>Cross
Sections</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-50" />) list. From the  expanded list, select the HEC-RAS cross section that contains the
representative hydrograph (e.g., <em><strong>Russian - DCtoOcean - 8693.624</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-50" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-50"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure50.png"
  alt="RAS Results Selector Dialog Box – Hydrograph from a Cross Section"
  caption="RAS Results Selector Dialog Box – Hydrograph from a Cross Section"
/>

1. Alternatively, to create the representative hydrograph from an HEC-RAS storage area location, from the <strong>RAS Results Selector</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-49" />), expand <strong>Storage</strong> <strong>Areas</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-51" />), and select
the HEC-RAS storage area that contains the representative hydrograph (e.g., <em><strong>367</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-51" />).

1. The <strong>RAS Unsteady Results Plot</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-50" />) located at the bottom of the <strong>RAS Results
Selector</strong> dialog box, displays the hydrograph for the selected cross section or storage area (<FigReference figKey="figure-51" />). The table
 section, located on the right side of the <strong>RAS Results Selector</strong>, displays the time series data for the representative hydrograph (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-51" />). Refer to [LifeSim Interface] for details regarding map window tools, table tools, and customizing plots
and plotting tools.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-51"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure51.png"
  alt="RAS Results Selector Dialog – Hydrograph from a Storage Area"
  caption="RAS Results Selector Dialog – Hydrograph from a Storage Area"
/>

1. Once the desired representative hydrograph is located and displayed, click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>RAS Results Selector</strong> dialog
box closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-51" />) and the selected hydrograph displays in the hydraulic data import dialog, in the
<strong>Hydrograph</strong> <strong>Definition</strong> panel.

1. From the hydraulic data import dialog, from the Hydrograph Definition panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-48" />), users can adjust the first
hydraulic timestep and hazard occurrence for the representative hydrograph. To complete the First Hydraulic Timestep and the Hazard Occurrence start
time adjustment refer to the instructions provided in [First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard
Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence).

### Import From Map

Another way to import the representative hydrograph from HEC-RAS Version 5.0 (and later) data, is from a "map" view of the data. Import from HEC-RAS
map data is only available from the Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) dialog (<FigReference figKey="figure-31" />) described in [Import from
HEC-RAS](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#import-from-hec-ras). To select the representative hydrograph from HEC-RAS map data, from the Import From HEC-RAS
(5.0 and later) dialog (<FigReference figKey="figure-31" />), click the Import From Map button (<FigReference figKey="figure-48" />) to open the RAS
 Map Data Selector dialog (<FigReference figKey="figure-52" />).

The <strong>RAS Map Data Selector</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-52" />) allows the user to specify a time series of depth at any point in
the HEC-RAS study area. This method is generally used when no detailed information is given regarding hazard occurrence timing relative to an HEC-RAS
geometric feature. Using the <strong>Select Hydrograph</strong> tool
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-0e12a458.png" />, the user can select a cross
section or storage area on the map and the data for the hydrograph from that selection area will appear (<FigReference figKey="figure-53" />).

Refer to [LifeSim Interface] for details regarding map window tools, table tools, customizing plots and plotting tools, and the animation toolbar.
However, the <strong>Select Hydrograph</strong> tool
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-0e12a458.png" /> is unique to the RAS Map Data
Selector (<FigReference figKey="figure-52" />) dialog box. This tool is the default selection upon opening the <strong>RAS Map Data Selector</strong>
 dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-52" />). This tool is what allows the user to specify a time series of depth at any point in the HEC-RAS
study area.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-52"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure52.png"
  alt="RAS Map Data Selector Dialog Box"
  caption="RAS Map Data Selector Dialog Box"
/>

To select the representative hydrograph from HEC-RAS Version 5.0 results, from the <strong>RAS Map Data Selector</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-53" />) dialog box, click the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-3fab41e7.png" /> button to start the animation in
the map window. At the desired water depth, pause the animation and click the <strong>Select Hydrograph</strong> tool
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-0e12a458.png" />, from the map window, click on a
location in the study area, a <strong>Progress Window</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-54" />) opens. The <strong>Progress Window</strong>
shows the collection of depth time series data for that selected point.

Once the desired representative hydrograph is displayed in the table and plot window, click OK, the RAS Map Data Selector (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-53" />) closes and the selected representative hydrograph is used for the hydraulic import. From the Import From
HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-57" />) the user can adjust the First Hydraulic Timestep and/or the Hazard
Occurrence start time ([Create Hydrograph Manually](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#create-hydrograph-manually)).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-53"

### Create Hydrograph Manually

Regardless of the hydraulic data import option used, the representative hydrograph can be created manually by entering the data by hand or copying and
 pasting the data from external source (e.g., Microsoft Excel, HEC-DSSVue). From the Hydrograph Definition panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-55" />
), available from all hydraulic data import options described in [Hydraulic Data Import
Options](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#hydraulic-data-import-options), users can enter the representative hydrograph manually in the Time and Values table (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-55" />). The date and time variable must be entered as: MMM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS (e.g., Jan-01-1900 00:00:00 in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-55" />).

The time series data can be entered by hand, copied from another hydraulic dataset or from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) and pasted
into the table (i.e., entire table, individual cells, columns, rows). From the <strong>Time</strong> and <strong>Values</strong> table (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-55" />), right-click to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-55" />), from the shortcut menu the
user can add, insert, and delete row(s); select all; copy or copy with headers; and paste.

For example, from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) select the date and value range of cells in the Excel spreadsheet and use <strong>Ctrl +
 C</strong> (or the <strong>Copy</strong> shortcut menu command) to copy the data to the clipboard. Return to the <strong>Time</strong> and
<strong>Values</strong> table (<FigReference figKey="figure-55" />) and select the first cell in the first row and use <strong>Ctrl + V</strong> to
paste all the copied data (<FigReference figKey="figure-56" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-55"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure55.png"
  alt="Example Hydraulic Data Importer – Hydrograph Definition Panel – Table Shortcuts"
  caption="Example Hydraulic Data Importer – Hydrograph Definition Panel – Table Shortcuts"
/>

<Figure
  figKey="figure-56"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure56.png"
  alt="Example Completed – Hydraulic Data Importer – Hydrograph Definition Panel"
  caption="Example Completed – Hydraulic Data Importer – Hydrograph Definition Panel"
/>

The hydrograph time series data can also be copied (with or without headers) into another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) for saving. Use
<strong>Ctrl + A</strong> (or the <strong>Select</strong> <strong>All</strong> command from the shortcut menu), right-click and select <strong>Copy w/
 Headers</strong>. Then paste the data in the desired application to save.

The Hydrograph Definition panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-55" />) contains a plot window (<FigReference figKey="figure-56" />), that provides a
live update for the data entered in the table. Review [Customizing Plots and Plotting
Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#customizing-plots-and-plotting-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting tools (located on the right
side of the plot window) and for customizing plots.

When the desired hydrograph data has been entered manually in the hydraulic data import dialog, from the Hydrograph Definition panel (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-48" />), users can adjust the first hydraulic timestep and hazard occurrence for the representative hydrograph. To
continue and complete the First Hydraulic Timestep and the Hazard Occurrence start time adjusted refer to the instructions provided in [First
Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence).

## First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard Occurrence

For all hydraulic data import options described in [Hydraulic Data Import Options](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#hydraulic-data-import-options), following
the hydraulic data import selection and selection of the representative hydrograph, from the Hydrograph Definition panel (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-57" />), the first hydraulic timestep and time of hazard occurrence (e.g., dam breach) must be set. Defining the
First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard Occurrence (<FigReference figKey="figure-57" />) are critical for LifeSim to correctly calculate hydraulic timing
 in relation to warning and evacuation information during the simulation. The first hydraulic timestep represents the start of the hydraulic data
(time 0) that has been imported. All hydraulic timing information will be calculated relative to the first hydraulic timestep. The hazard occurrence
time represents the time that the hazard occurs in the timeline. All warning and evacuation assumptions will be relative to the hazard occurrence
time.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-57"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure57.png"
  alt="Example – Import From FLO2D Dialog Box – First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard Occurrence"
  caption="Example – Import From FLO2D Dialog Box – First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard Occurrence"
/>

Once the representative hydrograph has been entered, the first hydraulic timestep can be modified. The first hydraulic timestep can be modified for
all hydraulic data import dialogs (<FigReference figKey="figure-57" />), except the <strong>Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later)</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-58" />). For the example in <FigReference figKey="figure-57" />, note that the <strong>First</strong>
<strong>Timestep</strong> plot slider is green
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-0c8c5109.png" /> and can be moved. However, for
the example provided in <FigReference figKey="figure-58" />, note that the <strong>First</strong> <strong>Timestep</strong> plot slider is gray
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-040857aa.png" /> and cannot be moved. Likewise,
the <strong>First Hydraulic Timestep</strong> date and time box is disabled in <FigReference figKey="figure-58" />, but is not disabled (can be
edited) in <FigReference figKey="figure-57" />. Instead, when the representative hydrograph is set using the <strong>Import From RAS</strong> option
the first hydraulic timestep is defined by the model output. All other hydraulic data import options allow the <strong>First Hydraulic
Timestep</strong> and the <strong>Hazard Occurrence</strong> start time to be adjusted by the user.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-58"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure58.png"
  alt="Example – Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) Dialog Box – First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard Occurrence"
  caption="Example – Import From HEC-RAS (5.0 and later) Dialog Box – First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard Occurrence"
/>

Users can set the first hydraulic timestep and hazard occurrence using the following options:

1. Enter the date and time manually. The date and time variable must be entered as: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM (e.g., <em><strong>06/03/2018 07:12</strong></em>
 in <FigReference figKey="figure-57" />).

1. Alternatively, use the green <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-0c8c5109.png" />
<strong>First</strong> <strong>Timestep</strong> plot slider and red
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-a307c03f.png" /> <strong>Hazard</strong>
<strong>Occurrence</strong> plot slider (<FigReference figKey="figure-57" />) to adjust the green and red dotted lines on the time series plot.

1. Users can also adjust the first hydraulic timestep and hazard occurrence by clicking the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-0080e7b8.png" /> button, that opens a calendar and
 time adjustment window (<FigReference figKey="figure-59" />). From the calendar panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-59" />), select the date. Use
the left and right arrows to select a preceding or subsequent month. From the time panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-59" />), first select the hour
 (displayed in military time), then select the minutes. To modify the hour or minutes selection click the displayed hour header (e.g.,
<em><strong>17</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-59" />) or the displayed minute header (e.g., <em><strong>14</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-59" />).

<Figure

  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure59.png"
  alt="Calendar and Time Adjustment Window"
  caption="Calendar and Time Adjustment Window"
/>

Once all of the appropriate information has been entered click <strong>OK</strong>, the hydraulic data importer dialog box closes (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-58" />). The hydraulic data is added to the study and displays in the <strong>Study Tree</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-29" />), under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>.

## Editing, Viewing, and Removing Hydraulic Datasets

Once hydraulic data has been added to the LifeSim study, a hydraulic dataset can be edited, deleted, viewed, moved, or a hydraulic summary of the data
 can be generated. Access the editing options, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong>
menu, point to <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>, point to <strong>Edit</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-60" />), and select the appropriate
hydraulic dataset. Alternatively, users can access the edit options for an individual hydraulic dataset from the LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong>, under
<strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>, right-click on a hydraulic dataset (e.g., <em><strong>EMB FAIL DF</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />). From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />), click <strong>Edit Hydrograph Data and
Timing</strong>.

### Generate Hydraulic Summary

The user can create an output shapefile based on any selected hydraulic scenario for point or polyline shapefiles. The created output shapefile
contains hydraulic information based on the selected scenario such as maximum depth, velocity, and key hydraulic threshold arrival times at each
feature in the selected point (e.g., structure inventory) or polyline (e.g., roads) shapefile. The hydraulic summary data can be useful in identifying
 potential issues in a structure inventory or road network; for example, structures inundated too quickly due to bad placement, or bridges that have
water underneath prior to the start of the flood event. To generate the hydraulic summary:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study</strong>
<strong>Tree</strong>, under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>, right-click on a hydraulic dataset (e.g., <em><strong>EMB FAIL DF</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />). From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />), click <strong>Generate Summary
Hydraulics</strong>. The <strong>Generate Hydraulic Summary</strong> dialog box opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-63" />).

1. The user needs to provide a name and a location to save the output shapefile. To the right of the <strong>Output Shapefile</strong> box click , a
<strong>Save As</strong> browser opens (<FigReference figKey="figure-64" />). Navigate to the directory to save the output shapefile. Enter a name
for the output shapefile in the <strong>File name</strong> box (<em>&#42;.shp</em>) and click <strong>Save</strong>. The <strong>Save As</strong> browser
closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-64" />) and the from the <strong>Generate Hydraulic Summary</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-63" />), the <strong>Output Shapefile</strong> box updates to display the pathname and shapefile name of the output
 shapefile.

  caption="Save As Browser"
/>

1. From the <strong>Input Shape Data</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-65" />) select the desired point or polyline shapefile. If no point
or polyline dataset exists in the map window, then to select the <strong>Input Shape Data</strong>, to the right of the list (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-63" />), click . An <strong>Open</strong> browser (<FigReference figKey="figure-4" />) opens, navigate to the
directory where the point or polyline shapefile is located. Select the correct shapefile (e.g., <em>&#42;.shp</em>), click <strong>Open</strong>, the
<strong>Open</strong> browser closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-4" />) and the user returns to the <strong>Generate Hydraulic Summary</strong>
dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-65" />).

/>

1. For the selected polyline <strong>Input Shape Data</strong> identify how the hydraulic summary should be generated either at the <strong>Mid
Point</strong> (default, and automatically selected for point shapefiles), <strong>End Point</strong>, and/or <strong>Quartile Points</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-65" />).

1. In the <strong>Hydraulic Output</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-63" />), set the <strong>Output to</strong> units to either
<strong>US Customary</strong> or <strong>System International (SI)</strong>. Units are either in feet or meters and depend on the <strong>Output
to</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-63" />) selection. In other words, if the hydraulic data is in feet and System International (SI) is
selected then the resulting output will be converted to meters.

1. By default, in the <strong>Hydraulic Output</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-63" />), the <strong>Maximum Depth</strong>,
<strong>Maximum Velocity</strong>, <strong>Maximum Depth Times Velocity</strong>, and <strong>Maximum Depth Times Velocity Squared</strong> hydraulic
output options have been selected. To unselect a default output selection, uncheck  the checkbox for the option.

1. From the <strong>Depth and Velocity Arrival Time (Minutes)</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-63" />), default values for
<strong>Arrival To Depth</strong> and <strong>Arrival To Velocity</strong> have been set. The default values can be modified, but no more than six
boxes per arrival time type can be identified per output shapefile. Not all six boxes require data.

1. Once all of the necessary and desired parameters have been set, click <strong>OK</strong>, a <strong>Progress Window</strong> opens (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-66" />) showing the progress of the hydraulic summary output shapefile creation. When processing of the output
shapefile is complete the <strong>Progress Window</strong> closes (<FigReference figKey="figure-66" />). The created hydraulic summary output
shapefile is saved in the appropriate location and displays in the map window.

### View a Hydraulic Dataset

Depending on which method was chosen to import hydraulic datasets for a LifeSim study, the user can view hydraulic datasets in the map window. To
display a hydraulic dataset feature in the map window, the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong>
tab, from the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong>, under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>, right-click on a hydraulic dataset (e.g.,
<em><strong>EMB FAIL DF</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-61" />). From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />) click
<strong>Display </strong><em>"hydraulic dataset feature"</em>.

In general, the available display options are:

- Display Max Depth (LifeSim created <em>Max_Depth.vrt</em> and <em>&#42;.tif</em> files)

- Display Max Velocity (LifeSim created <em>Max_Velocity.vrt</em> and <em>&#42;.tif</em> files)

If the hydraulic data is imported from HEC-RAS data then from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the
<strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong>, under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>, right-click on a hydraulic
dataset (e.g., <em><strong>EMB FAIL DF</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-61" />). From the shortcut menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />), point to <strong>RAS GIS Data</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />) and the shortcut sub-menu
will display one or more of the following options:

- Display Cross Sections (LifeSim created shapefile (<em>&#42;.shp</em>) file)

- Display Storage Areas (LifeSim created shapefile (<em>&#42;.shp</em>) file)

- Display 2D Flow Areas (LifeSim created shapefile (<em>&#42;.shp</em>) file)

- Display Hydrograph Selection Point (LifeSim created shapefile (<em>&#42;.shp</em>) file)

Note, the above files are created in the Hydraulic_Data sub-directory when the files are added to the map window.

To remove a hydraulic dataset feature displayed in the map window, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the
<strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong> folder, right-click on a hydraulic dataset, from the shortcut menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />), and click <strong>Remove </strong><em>"hydraulic dataset feature"</em><strong> From the Map
Window</strong>. Or remove the map layer from the map window (Appendix A).

### Move a Hydraulic Dataset

To move specific hydraulic datasets up or down in the <strong>Study Tree</strong>:

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study</strong>
<strong>Tree</strong>, under <strong>Hydraulic Data</strong>, right-click on a hydraulic dataset (e.g., <em><strong>EMB FAIL DF</strong></em> in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />). From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />), click <strong>Move Up</strong>, the
selected dataset will move up one layer in the <strong>Study Tree</strong>.

1. To move the selected dataset down, from the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-61" />), click <strong>Move Down</strong>.
