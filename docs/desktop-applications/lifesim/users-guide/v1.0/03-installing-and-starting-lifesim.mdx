# Installing and Starting LifeSim

This chapter describes the recommended computer system requirements for installing and running LifeSim. The software includes a graphical user
interface (GUI) designed to increase the usability and efficiency of the software. The LifeSim GUI provides for file management, data entry and
editing, and viewing output results.

## Requirements

- **Installation:** about 180MB (megabytes) of hard disk space
- **Memory:** 1GB (gigabytes) RAM (random access memory); recommended 4GB RAM
- **Operating System:** Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1/Windows 10, Windows 11
- Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.0

## Installation

<Button href="https://github.com/USACE-RMC/LifeSim/releases/download/v2.1.6/LifeSim_2.1.6.7z"><u>ðŸ¡‡</u> LifeSim v2.1.6</Button>

LifeSim Version 2.1.6 is available for download as a self-extracting setup package.

The installer (with administrative privileges) will run through selecting an install location (e.g., *C:\Program Files*).

## Starting LifeSim

To start LifeSim, navigate to the install directory location chosen in the section above. The software will be within a Compressed Archive Folder (<em>*.7z</em>). 

Select **Extract All** in *File Explorer*. Navigate to the extracted folder and double-click the <FigureInline src="img/LifeSim.png"/> **LifeSim.exe**. 
The main window of LifeSim will appear (<FigReference figKey="figure-1"/> below), and you are ready to begin.

Users may **Pin to Start**, **Pin to Taskbar**, or **Create Desktop Shortcut** for easy access to the LifeSim software.

## Creating a Study

A study in LifeSim is a combination of the data, models, or events required to analyze a specific geographical area. The study represents all the
input data and simulation output required to adequately answer the question of estimating consequences from a hazard. 

There are two ways to create a study.

**Option 1: From the File Menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-2"/>)**

From the main window, select **File** in the [*Menu Bar*](#figure-1), and select **Create New**. 

**Option 2: From the Study Tree (<FigReference figKey="newfigure-1"/>)**

In the [*Study Tree*](#figure-1), right-click **New Study** and select **Create New**.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 items-end">
  <Figure
    figKey="figure-2"
    src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure2.png"
    alt="File Menu > Create New"
    caption="File Menu > Create New"
  />
  <Figure

    alt="Study Tree > Create New"
    caption="Study Tree > Create New"
  />
</div>

Either way, the **Save As** browser will open (<FigReference figKey="figure-3"/> below). From the **Save As** browser, navigate to the location (directory) where the 
LifeSim study will be created. Enter a project name (required) in the **File name** box.

{/*Comment for Woody or other reviewer: Include the below three lines? Agree with it? Please revise as necessary or delete.*/}
Best practice for project name is *ProjectName_LifeSimVersion_YYYY* (e.g., *xyzDam_RiskAssessment_LifeSim216_2025*) where:
- Date format is YYYY, the year of the project creation.
- LifeSimVersion is the version of LifeSim used to create or update the project (e.g., *LifeSim216* for LifeSim Version 2.1.6).

Click **Save**, and the **Save** **As** browser will close. The LifeSim main window will now have the name of the study in the 
[*Study Tree*](#figure-1) and the [*Title Bar*](#figure-1).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-3"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure3.png"
  alt="Save As Browser"
  caption="Save As Browser"
/>

A directory with the study name and associated files will be created for the study.

## Opening an Existing Study

It is important to note that at this time, LifeSim Version 2.1.6 cannot open or update LifeSim Version 1.0 studies. 

**To open an existing LifeSim study:**

From the [LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-1"/>)](#figure-1), click **File** in the *Menu Bar*,
and select **Open Existing**. The *File Explorer* will automatically open. Navigate to your project directory location and 
click the LifeSim study file (<em>*.fia</em>) (<FigReference figKey="figure-4"/> below). The **File name** box will now contain 
the filename (e.g., *Example_Project_1.fia*).

Another way is from the [*Study Tree*](#figure-1), right-click **New Study**, select **Open Existing**, and follow the same preceeding steps.

Select **Open** in the *File Explorer*.

/>

LifeSim now displays the selected study in the [*Study Tree*](#figure-1), and the study name will display 
in the [*Title Bar*](#figure-1).

    src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/newfigure-2.png"

    caption="Study name displayed in Study Tree and Title Bar"
  />

## Study Directories and Files

Directories and files are automatically created by LifeSim to store information. As data is entered, subsequent files and subdirectories are created.
A description of the created directories is provided below:

### <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-folder.png"/> LifeSim Example Model

Study folder that is created 
when a user creates a new study.

### <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-fia.png" /> <em>*.fia</em>

File created by LifeSim when a 
study is created. Contains the name and description of the study, map properties, and
references to the LifeSim study elements. The <em>*.fia</em> file also holds the following study data:

- **Structure Inventory:** Contains all of the information about the imported and defined structure inventory, damage categories and structure occupancy
 types.
- **Emergency Planning Zones (EPZ) Data:** Contains all of the information about the imported and defined EPZ data.
- **Road Network:** Contains all of the information about the imported and defined road network.
- **Destination Data:** Contains the created destination data.
- **Alternative Data:** The created alternative is saved as an XML file.
- **Simulations:** Contains all of the created and computed simulation data.

### <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-folder.png"/> Hydraulic_Data
Sub-directory created by LifeSim when hydraulic data is imported. Contains files that define data items for imported hydraulic data. Also,
sub-directories are created when hydraulic data is defined and are dependent on the hydraulic data import option utilized.

### <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-folder.png"/> Agricultural_Data
Sub-directory created by LifeSim when agriculture data is imported. Contains the created agriculture data geotiff.
