# Alternatives

An <strong>alternative</strong> in LifeSim allows the user to define what input data sources and parameters will make up the simulation computations.
Any combination of input data sources can be used to define an alternative. For example, one alternative may use a road network that allows for
contra-flow and another may use a different hydraulic event or different warning issuance times. Setting up multiple alternatives allows the user to
quantify and compare the effects of operational changes on the hazard analysis. Alternatives in LifeSim represent the parameters that define a
simulation and include defining:

- Input data sources (e.g., hydraulics, structure inventory, road network, ECAM data),

- Warning issuance times,

- Destination locations by Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ), and

- Various other parameters (e.g., evacuation parameters, life loss probability, stability criteria).

## Create an Alternative

To create an alternative in LifeSim the user will provide a name, define the input data sources, and provide additional information (e.g., evacuation
parameters).

1. From the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-164" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the <strong>Study Tree</strong>,
right-click on <strong>Alternatives</strong>, and click <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> from the shortcut menu. Alternatively, from the
LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Alternatives</strong>, and click <strong>Create New</strong>.

  caption="Example -- LifeSim Main Window – ECAM Data Displayed in Map Window"
/>

### Define Input Data Sources

From the <strong>Input Data Sources</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />), select the desired simulation compute options and define
the desired input datasets for the new alternative.

1. By default, LifeSim will create a traffic simulation of the evacuation. To turn off the traffic simulation option, from the <strong>Input Data
Sources</strong> panel, uncheck  the <strong>Simulate Traffic</strong> checkbox (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />).

1. By default, the <strong>Calculate</strong> <strong>Life</strong> <strong>Loss</strong> (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />) option is turned on.
 To turn off the life loss calculation option, from the <strong>Input Data Sources</strong> panel, uncheck  the <strong>Calculate Life Loss</strong>
checkbox (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />).

1. NOTE: If <strong>Simulate Traffic</strong> and <strong>Calculate Life Loss</strong> are turned off, then the road network and destinations datasets
 do not need to be defined.

  alt="LifeSim Main Window – Study Menu Alternatives Sub-menu – Alternatives Study Tree Shortcut Menu"
  caption="LifeSim Main Window – Study Menu Alternatives Sub-menu – Alternatives Study Tree Shortcut Menu"
/>

1. From the Input Data Sources panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />), from the Hydraulic Event list, select a hydraulic dataset. If the
selected hydraulic dataset requires editing, from the Create New Alternative dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />), click , and the
Select Hydrograph and Timing Information dialog box opens (see [Editing, Viewing, and Removing Hydraulic
Datasets](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#editing-viewing-and-removing-hydraulic-datasets) for further information).

1. From the <strong>Structure Inventory</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />), select a structure inventory.

1. From the <strong>Emergency Planning Zone</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />), select an EPZ dataset. If the selected EPZ dataset
requires editing, from the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />), click
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" />, and the <strong>Emergency
Planning Zone Editor</strong> opens (see [EPZ Editor](#emergency-planning-zone-epz-editor) for further information).

1. When simulating traffic (<strong>Simulate Traffic</strong> checkbox is selected) select the appropriate road network dataset from the
<strong>Road</strong> <strong>Network</strong> list, from the <strong>Input Data Sources</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />). If the
selected road network dataset requires editing, from the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />),
click <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" />, and the <strong>Edit Road
Network</strong> dialog box opens (see [Edit a Road Network Dataset](#edit-a-road-network-dataset for further information).

1. When simulating traffic select the appropriate destinations dataset from the <strong>Destinations</strong> list, from the <strong>Input Data
Sources</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />).

1. Below the Input Data Sources panel, select either US Customary or System International (SI) for the alternative. The Public Warning Issuance,
Destination Assignments, Evacuation Parameters, Life Loss Probability, Stability Criteria, and Agriculture tabs, at the bottom of the Create New
Alternative dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />), provide the parameters for defining the simulation compute options. [Compute Options
for an Alternative](./12-alternatives.mdx#compute-options-for-an-alternative) describes the steps for defining the compute options for an alternative,
 for each tab in the Create New Alternative dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />).

1. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />) closes. The alternative
is created and appears in the <strong>Study</strong> <strong>Tree</strong> under <strong>Alternatives</strong> in LifeSim main window (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-164" />).

### Compute Options for an Alternative

LifeSim can analyze a variety of flood damages and impacts through a variety of computational methods. Flood damages and impacts as well as the
methods used to estimate the impacts are selected as part of an alternative definition. For example, when simulating traffic and life loss, then users
 must define warning issuance scenarios, destination assignments, evacuation parameters, life loss probability functions, and stability threshold
functions. The following sections describe the steps for defining the compute options for an alternative individually for each tab in the
<strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-170"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure170.png"
  alt="Create New Alternative Dialog Box"
  caption="Create New Alternative Dialog Box"
/>

Note, for the purposes of the discussion the units listed in this section will be in US Customary units. However, the <strong>Create New
Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) allows users to select either <strong>US Customary</strong> or <strong>System
International (SI)</strong>.

#### Public Warning Issuance

When simulating life loss, with or without simulating traffic or ECAM, the warning issuance times must be defined. To define the warning issuance
scenarios:

1. From the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />), click the <strong>Public Warning
Issuance</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />).

1. The <strong>Emergency Planning Zone</strong> list is a list of all the emergency planning zones in the selected EPZ dataset (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-166" />). Therefore, if a selected EPZ dataset has multiple zones then the list will contain the names of the
multiple zones.

The public warning issuance scenario has three parameters. Each parameter can be defined with uncertainty and is used to define when warnings are
issued to the population by zone in the emergency planning zone (EPZ) (<FigReference figKey="figure-168" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-171"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure171.png"
  alt="Create New Alternative Dialog Box – Input Data Sources"
  caption="Create New Alternative Dialog Box – Input Data Sources"
/>

1. The Imminent Hazard ID Time (Hours) parameter (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) is the period of time, in hours, between when the hazard is
identified (ID) and the hazard occurs as defined by the selected hydraulic data. See [First Hydraulic Timestep and Hazard
Occurrence](./05-hydraulic-data.mdx#first-hydraulic-timestep-and-hazard-occurrence) for more information on the hazard occurrence time. From the
Uncertainty Type dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />), select and define the uncertainty in imminent hazard ID time. The default is
None, however, the user can choose Triangular (minimum, maximum), Normal (standard deviation), and Uniform (minimum, maximum).

1. The <strong>Hazard Communication Delay (Hours)</strong> parameter (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) is the period of time between when the
hazard is identified to when the EPZ representatives or Emergency Management Agency (EMA) is alerted. From the <strong>Uncertainty Type</strong>
dropdown menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />), select and define the uncertainty. The default is <strong>None</strong>, however, the user can
choose <strong>Triangular</strong> (minimum, maximum), <strong>Normal</strong> (standard deviation), and <strong>Uniform</strong> (minimum, maximum).

1. The <strong>Warning Issuance Delay</strong> parameter (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) is the time it takes from when the emergency managers
 receive the notification of the imminent hazard to when they issue an evacuation order to the public.

1. The <strong>Warning Issuance Delay</strong> is part of the warning issuance process, but it is defined in the emergency planning zone (EPZ)
dataset. However, if the warning issuance delay parameters require editing, click
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-652a5282.png" />, to open the <strong>Emergency
Planning Zone Editor</strong> and edit the warning issuance delay (see [EPZ Editor](#emergency-planning-zone-epz-editor) for further information).
NOTE: By default, the <strong>Emergency Planning Zone Editor</strong> opens to the <strong>Warning Issuance Delay</strong> tab for the first EPZ zone
in the <strong>Emergency Planning Zone</strong> list (in the <strong>Emergency Planning Zone Editor</strong>). In other words, the EPZ zone selected from
 the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> (e.g., <em>Geyserville</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) does not modify the EPZ selected in
 the opened <strong>Emergency Planning Zone Editor</strong>.

1. Either click <strong>OK</strong> to save the alternative and close the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) or select the next desired tab and continue to define the new alternative.

#### Destination Assignments

When simulating traffic (<strong>Simulate Traffic</strong> checkbox is selected, <FigReference figKey="figure-166" />) the user needs to define the
destinations for the emergency planning zones; from the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />),
click the <strong>Destination Zone Assignment</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-169" />).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-172"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure172.png"
  alt="Create New Alternative – Public Warning Issuance Tab"
  caption="Create New Alternative – Public Warning Issuance Tab"
/>

The <strong>Destination</strong> <strong>Assignments</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-169" />) is divided into two panels. The left panel,
lists all of the emergency planning zones in the selected EPZ dataset (e.g., <em>Example_EPZ</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-169" />).
Therefore, if a selected EPZ dataset has multiple zones then the list will contain the names of the multiple zones. The right panel, provides a list
of all of the destination names in the destination’s dataset (e.g., <em>Ex_Destinations</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-169" />).

The user can define unique (for multiple zones when present) destinations for selected EPZs. For example, if the warning message content for a
particular EPZ dictates specific destination locations those locations can be defined and people within the EPZ will attempt to evacuate to one of the
 specified destination locations. To assign specific destinations to unique or multiple zones:

1. From the left panel, select the desired EPZ name (e.g., <em>Cloverdale</em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-169" />).

1. From the list of destinations in the right panel, select an individual destination or multiple destinations by checking  the checkbox.

1. By default, all the destinations are selected, to unselect all destinations, click <strong>Select All</strong> (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-169" />). Alternatively, to reselect all destinations, click <strong>Select All</strong>.

1. Continue through the list of zones and list of destinations to assign the correct destinations to the correct zones.

1. Once all desired destinations have been assigned, either click <strong>OK</strong> to save the alternative and close the <strong>Create New
Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) or select the next desired tab and continue to define the new alternative.

#### Evacuation Parameters

When simulating life loss the <strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-170" />) allows the user to
adjust the default traffic evacuation simulation parameters in LifeSim. The <strong>Evacuation</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-170" />) contains two panels.

The <strong>Evacuations</strong> <strong>Parameters</strong> panel on the left (<FigReference figKey="figure-170" />), contains a list of traffic
simulation parameters with defaults (<TableReference tableKey="table-5" />). All available evacuation parameters are set with defaults, but the user
can adjust the parameters by modifying the default values.

The <strong>Depth</strong> <strong>Driven</strong> <strong>Willingness</strong> <strong>To</strong> <strong>Enter</strong> <strong>Flooded</strong>
<strong>Road</strong> panel on the right (<FigReference figKey="figure-170" />), is new to LifeSim Version 2.0. From the <strong>Depth Driven
Willingness To Enter Flooded Road</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-170" />), users can define probability density functions for low
clearance (cars) and high clearance (trucks) vehicles willingness to enter (ford) flooded roads. During the evacuation simulation vehicles
encountering a flooded road will either attempt to ford the road or will attempt to turn around depending on the defined willingness to enter
functions. The LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 6, provides extensive detail regarding evacuation parameters and depth driven
willingness to enter flooded roads.

From the <strong>Depth Driven Willingness To Enter Flooded Road</strong> panel (<FigReference figKey="figure-170" />), users can define probability
density functions for low clearance (cars) and high clearance (trucks) vehicles willingness to enter (ford) flooded roads. During the evacuation
simulation vehicles encountering a flooded road will either attempt to ford the road or will attempt to turn around depending on the defined
willingness to enter functions.

#### Life Loss Probability

The <strong>Life Loss Probability</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-173" />), allows the user to adjust the default fatality rate curves
that are used to define probability of life loss for the high and low hazard zones. In LifeSim Version 1.0, default fatality rate curves were
developed for three zones: chance, compromised and safe. However, in LifeSim Version 2.0, the original three zones were replaced with two new zones:
low and high hazard. The LifeSim Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual, Chapter 9, Section 9.2, provides a detailed explanation regarding the
development of the two new zones and the fatality rate functions for the new zones.

LifeSim Version 2.0 characterizes each agent as either being in high hazard or low hazard conditions as described below:

- <strong>High Hazard Zone:</strong> Refers to those conditions where the stability criteria or submergence criteria of the person, the vehicle (if
caught while evacuating), or the structure (if not mobilized) has been exceeded. When the stability (or submergence) criteria has been exceeded
survival depends largely on chance.

- <strong>Low Hazard Zone: </strong>Refers to those conditions where the person or group of people are exposed to relatively calm floodwaters, where
the stability of the individual, group, or shelter is not at risk. A hazard exists due to the potential for bad things to happen when people come in
contact with water in locations not meant for such an interaction.

To modify the default fatality rate curves:

1. From the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />), select the <strong>Life Loss
Probability</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-173" />). The <strong>Life Loss Probability</strong> tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-173" />
) provides a dropdown menu to select the desired zone (e.g., <strong>High Hazard</strong> in <FigReference figKey="figure-173" />) and view or modify
 the curve data.

1. The <strong>Relative Frequency of Exceedance</strong> (X-Axis) represents the probability of a receiving a particular fatality rate. The
<strong>Proportional Life Loss</strong> (Y-Axis) represents the fatality rate. Using the default high hazard data (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-173" />), if 100 people were in the high hazard zone 47 of them would have a 100 percent fatality rate.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-176"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure176.png"
  alt="Evacuation Parameters Tab – Depth Driven Willingness To Enter Flooded Road Panel"
  caption="Evacuation Parameters Tab – Depth Driven Willingness To Enter Flooded Road Panel"
/>

1. The default life loss probability functions can be edited manually or copied from another application (e.g., Microsoft Excel®) and pasted into the
table (i.e., entire table, individual cells, columns, rows). From the table, right-click a cell (or group of selected cells) to open the shortcut menu
 (<FigReference figKey="figure-5" /> 27), from the shortcut menu the user can add, insert, and delete row(s); select all; copy or copy with headers;
and paste.

1. Errors in the life loss probability function are highlighted in red and a tooltip displays a message describing the error (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-5" /> 28). Right-click on a header row to open the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-5" /> 28) to sort
the table in ascending or descending order or clear the table sorting.

1. The Hazard Zone plot (<FigReference figKey="figure-173" />) provides a live update for the data entered in the table. Review [Table
Tools](./04-lifesim-interface.mdx#table-tools) for instructions on using the general plotting tools (located on the right side of the plot window) and
 for customizing plots.

1. When done evaluating/modifying the life loss probability for the two zones, either click <strong>OK</strong> to save the alternative and close the
<strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) or select the next desired tab and continue to define the
new alternative.

#### Stability Criteria

The <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />), <strong>Stability Criteria</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-174" />) allows users to adjust the default stability criteria for three groups: human stability and low and high
clearance vehicles. The user can adjust the default stability criteria thresholds (depth, velocity, and functional) for the three groups. The LifeSim
Version 2.0 Technical Reference Manual provides more information on the human and vehicle stability criteria.

To modify the default functions:

1. From the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />), <strong>Stability Criteria</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-174" />). From the <strong>Stability Criteria</strong> dropdown list, select the desired group (e.g., <strong>Low
Clearance Vehicles</strong> in <FigReference figKey="figure-174" />).

1. The user can modify the uncertainty about the three thresholds for the selected stability criteria group. From the <strong>Uncertainty
Type</strong> dropdown menu, select the desired uncertainty type and define the uncertainty parameters for the threshold. Modify the listed stability
criteria parameters (<FigReference figKey="figure-174" />) by entering values into the fields manually.

1. The <strong>Functional</strong> <strong>Threshold</strong> has an additional parameter for selecting the function type, from the
<strong>Function</strong> <strong>Type</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-174" />), as either <strong>Depth&#42;Velocity</strong> or
<strong>Depth&#42;(Velocity Squared)</strong>.

1. When done evaluating/modifying the stability criteria parameters for all three groups (humans, low and high clearance vehicles), either click
<strong>OK</strong> to save the alternative and close the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />)
or select the next desired tab and continue to define the new alternative.

#### Agriculture

The <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />), <strong>Agriculture</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-175" />) allows users set the agriculture inventory for the alternative and enter a specific hydraulic event
starting date for calculating the agricultural flood damages.

To calculate agriculture damages for the created alternative:

1. From the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-165" />), select the <strong>Agriculture</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-175" />).

1. Turn on the agricultural damages calculation option by checking  the checkbox in the header of <strong>Agriculture</strong> tab (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-175" />). By default, calculating agriculture damages is turned off (checkbox is unchecked  ).

1. From the <strong>Agriculture Inventory</strong> list (<FigReference figKey="figure-175" />), select the desired dataset (e.g.,
<em><strong>AgData_2010</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-175" />).

1. From the <strong>Hydraulic Event Start Date</strong> box (<FigReference figKey="figure-175" />), click the
{"\n"}<FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/lifesim/users-guide/v1.0/inline-images/inline-d3ff7467.png" /> button to open the date selector
window and set the desired hydraulic event starting date (e.g., <em><strong>January 21</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-175" />).

1. The <strong>Hydraulic</strong> <strong>Scenario</strong> plot (<FigReference figKey="figure-175" />) updates by starting the first timestep in the
 selected hydraulic dataset (e.g., <em><strong>Base for Real Time forecasting</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) based on the
selected <strong>Hydraulic Event Start Date</strong>.

1. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the alternative and close the <strong>Create New Alternative</strong> dialog box (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-167" />) or select the next desired tab and continue to define and/or edit the alternative.

## Edit an Alternative

To edit an alternative, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-164" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the
<strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Alternatives</strong> folder, right-click on an alternative name (e.g.,
<em><strong>ALT_LL_Traffic</strong></em> in <FigReference figKey="figure-176" />). From the shortcut menu (<FigReference figKey="figure-176" />),
click <strong>Edit</strong>.

Alternatively, from the LifeSim main window, from the Study menu, point to Alternatives (<FigReference figKey="figure-164" />), point to Edit, click
on an alternative name. Either way the Alternative Editor will open (similar to <FigReference figKey="figure-167" />). See [Create an
Alternative](./12-alternatives.mdx#create-an-alternative) for more information regarding the editable fields in the Alternative Editor.

## Copy an Alternative

To copy an alternative, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-164" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the
<strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Alternatives </strong>folder, right-click on an alternative name. From the shortcut menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-176" />), click <strong>Copy</strong>. Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the <strong>Study</strong>
 menu, point to <strong>Alternatives</strong>, point to <strong>Copy</strong>, click on an alternative name.

Either way, the <strong>Name of New Study Item</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />) opens. Enter a new name in the
<strong>Name</strong> box. Click <strong>OK</strong>, the <strong>Name of New Study Item</strong> dialog box (<FigReference figKey="figure-86" />)
closes and the copied alternative is added to the <strong>Study Tree</strong> under the <strong>Alternatives</strong> folder.

## Delete an Alternative

To delete an alternative, from the LifeSim main window (<FigReference figKey="figure-164" />), from the <strong>Study</strong> tab, from the
<strong>Study Tree</strong>, from the <strong>Alternatives</strong> folder, right-click on an alternative name. From the shortcut menu (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-176" />), click <strong>Delete</strong>. Another way is from the LifeSim main window, from the
<strong>Study</strong> menu, point to <strong>Alternatives</strong>, point to <strong>Delete</strong>, click on an alternative name. Either way a
