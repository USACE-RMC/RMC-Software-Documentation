# Example 1 - Single Failure Mode

The first example illustrates the basic steps of setting up a risk analysis for a single hydrologically driven potential failure mode (PFM) of backward
erosion piping (BEP) in RMC-TotalRisk. The spillway gates were assumed to oeprate as intended (100% reliability) for this risk analysis.

## Hazards

The hydrologic hazard is represented by a stage frequency curve and provided in tabular format. Relationships for the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile,
50<sup>th</sup> percentile, and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) were provided for each stage. To begin building the
model, add a tabular hazard function as demonstrated in the following steps and in <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>.

1. Right-click on the <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/folder.png"/> **Hazards** folder in
   the Project Explorer window and select <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/addtabularhazard.png"/>
   **Add Tabular Hazard...** Name the hazard function in the prompt (e.g., Stage Frequency) and press **OK**.

2. The hazard for the stage frequency curve is stage and is measured in feet. In the **Tabular Hazard Properties** section of the Properties
   window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>(a), select _Stage_ for **Hazard Type** and _ft_ for **Hazard Units**.

3. The stage frequency curve is generally plotted on a normal probability-linear scale (i.e., AEP plotted on the x-axis on a normal probability scale
   and stage plotted on the y-axis on a linear scale). In the **Interpolation Transforms** section of the Properties window, the **Hazard** is set to
   _None_ (linear interpolation), and the **Probability** is set to _Normal Z-variate_, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>(b).

4. The stage frequency data contains fixed stages and uncertainty for the AEP values. Since uncertainty is defined for the probabilities in the stage
   frequency relationship and not the hazard, the **Uncertain Value** drop-down menu is set to _Probability_. Select an appropriate input distribution that
   best defines the stage frequency dataset and enter the data into the hazard function. Uncertainty in the AEP is defined by 5<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>,
   and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile values. _PERT-Percentile Z_ is selected from the **Distribution** drop-down menu as is typical for this type of analysis.
   Enter the hazard function from <TableReference parentDocId="105_1_0" tableKey="example-1-stage-frequency"/> by copying and pating into the table as indicated
   in <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>(c).

## Transforms

The stage frequency, system response, and consequence data for this risk analysis are all a function of stage (ft). Therefore, a transform function is not required
for this analysis.

## System Responses

The system response probabilities for the backward erosion piping potential failure mode were obtained from team elicitation using the event tree method. The elicited
system response probabilities are shown in <TableReference parentDocId="105_1_0" tableKey="example-1-bep-srp"/>, and the corresponding failure mode event tree is shown
in <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-et"/>.

To build the event tree system response function for the BEP PFM, use the following procedure:

1. Right-click on the <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/folder.png"/> **System Response** folder in
   the Project Explorer window and select <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/addeventtree.png"/>
   **Add Event Tree Response...** Name the system response function in the prompt (e.g., Backward Erosion Piping with Intervention). RMC-TotalRisk contains
   a database of event trees for common potential failure modes that can be used for system response functions. For BEP, select _Flood_ from the **Category**
   drop-down menu and select _Backward Erosion Piping_ from the **Template** drop-down menu and press **OK**.

2. The hazard for the system response function is stage and is measured in feet. In the **Event Tree Properties** section of the Properties
   window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-hazard-levels"/>(a), select _Stage_ for **Hazard Type** and _ft_ for **Hazard Units**.

3. In the **Interpolation Transforms section of the Properties window, select interpolation methods that are best suited for teh hazard and system response
   probability. For this PFM, the **Hazard** is set to _None_ (linear interpolation), and the **Probability\*\* is set to _Logarithmic_, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-hazard-levels"/>(b).

4. Assign the hazard levels that define the system response curve to the event tree by clicking on the Initiating
   Hazard <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/hazardnode.png"/>
   symbol, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-hazard-levels"/>(c), and entering the hazard levels into the **Hazard Levels** section
   of the Properties window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-hazard-levels"/>(d). Alternatively, hazard levels can be assigned
   by hovering over the Initiating Hazard node name, clicking the Branch Properties <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/branchproperties.png"/>
   symbol, and entering the hazard levels into the **Hazard Levels** section of the pop-up box that appears. The BEP PFM uses six hazard levels to define the
   system response curve as shown in <TableReference parentDocId="105_1_0" tableKey="example-1-bep-srp"/>. Click the add
   row <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/addrow.png"/> symbol to add a new row to the bottom of the
   hazard level table.

5. Ensure the structure of the event tree, including the number, name, and description of each node, matches the potential failure mode being evaluated. To
   add a branch to the event tree or delete a branch from the event tree, click on the symbol <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/chancenode.png"/>
   and perform one of the following options:

   - Click the **Add new branch** <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/newbranch.png"/> button (to add a
     branch) or the **Delete all branches from this node** <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/deletebranches.png"/>
     button (to delete branches) in the node toolbar, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-branch-props"/>(a).

   - Click the **Add Branch Node** <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/newbranch.png"/> button (to add a
     branch) or the **Delete Branch** <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/deletebranch.png"/> button (to
     delete branches) in the **Sub-Branches** section of the Properties window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-branch-props"/>(b).

6. The **Name** and **Description** of the node can be changed in the **Select Branch Properties** section of the Properties window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-branch-props"/>(c),
   or by clicking the Branch Properties <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/branchproperties.png"/> symbol.

7. Edit the nodal properties and enter system response probabilities for each node from <TableReference parentDocId="105_1_0" tableKey="example-1-bep-srp" />
   into the event tree. Select an event tree node by clicking on the event tree node symbol or name, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-srp-input" />(a).
   Assign system response probabilities using the options located in the **System Response** section of the Properties window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-srp-input" />(b).
   The **Source** and **Distribution** options for the system response probabilities should be assigned to fit the probabilities estimated by the risk assessment team.
   Node 1 in the BEP PFM is a stage-independent node, indicating that the probabilities do not change with stage, and was estimated with a minimum or lowest
   reasonable value (LRV), most likely value (MLV), and a maximum or highest reasonable value (HRV). The **Source** for Node 1 is set to _Single Value_
   and the **Distribution** is set to _Triangular_.

8. The system response probabilities for Node 2 in the BEP PFM event tree are stage-independent but are only represented by a most likely value wthout a probability
   distribution. To assign system response probabilities for Node 2, the **Source** is set to _Single Value_ and the **Distribution** is set to
   _Deterministic_, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-node-inputs" />. The system response probabilities for Node 3 are stage-dependent
   (i.e., the probabilities change with stage) and are represented by a LRV, MLV, and HRV. For Node 3, the **Source** is set to _Multi Value_ and the **Distribution**
   is set to _Triangular_, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-node-inputs" />. Assign the system response probabilities for the remaining nodes
   of the event tree using the same procedure.

9. Once the event tree has been completed, click on the **Response** tab within the event tree window to view a graph of the system response curve plotted against
   stage. The mean system response curve is plotted with a blue dashed line, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-srp-plot" />(a), and the
   90% confidence bounds are shaded in light blue, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-srp-plot" />(b). This curve can be compared against
   the system response probability input data to ensure accuracy. To change the graph axis extents, axis type, or axis properties, right click on the axis of
   interest and click _Format Axis: [Axis Name Here]_, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-srp-plot" />(c). The **Axis Type** can be
   set to _Linear_, _Logarithmic_, _Normal Probability_, or _Gumbel Probability_ in the **Axis Type** drop-down menu within the **Properties**
   window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-bep-srp-plot" />(d), along with other axis customizations.

## Consequences

### Life Loss function

For this example, daytime and nighttime life loss estimates were developed for a range of reservoir stages for both non-breach and breach scenarios. The daytime
exposure scenario rate was assumed to be 45% while the nighttime exposure rate was assumed to be 55%. Three consequence functions are created in RMC-TotalRisk:
Day, Night, and Composite. The composite curves are created using the day and night scenarios weighted by their respective exposure rates.
