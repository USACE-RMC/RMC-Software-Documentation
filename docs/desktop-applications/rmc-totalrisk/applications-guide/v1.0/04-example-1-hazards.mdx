# Hazards

The hydrologic hazard is represented by a stage frequency curve and provided in tabular format. Relationships for the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile,
50<sup>th</sup> percentile, and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile annual exceedance probabilities (AEP) were provided for each stage. To begin building the
model, add a tabular hazard function as demonstrated in the following steps and in <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>.

1. Right-click on the <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/folder.png"/> **Hazards** folder in
   the Project Explorer window and select <FigureInline src="/figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/applications-guide/icons/addtabularhazard.png"/>
   **Add Tabular Hazard...** Name the hazard function in the prompt (e.g., Stage Frequency) and press **OK**.

2. The hazard for the stage frequency curve is stage and is measured in feet. In the **Tabular Hazard Properties** section of the Properties
   window, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>(a), select _Stage_ for **Hazard Type** and _ft_ for **Hazard Units**.

3. The stage frequency curve is generally plotted on a normal probability-linear scale (i.e., AEP plotted on the x-axis on a normal probability scale
   and stage plotted on the y-axis on a linear scale). In the **Interpolation Transforms** section of the Properties window, the **Hazard** is set to
   _None_ (linear interpolation), and the **Probability** is set to _Normal Z-variate_, <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>(b).

4. The stage frequency data contains fixed stages and uncertainty for the AEP values. Since uncertainty is defined for the probabilities in the stage
   frequency relationship and not the hazard, the **Uncertain Value** drop-down menu is set to _Probability_. Select an appropriate input distribution that
   best defines the stage frequency dataset and enter the data into the hazard function. Uncertainty in the AEP is defined by 5<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>,
   and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile values. _PERT-Percentile Z_ is selected from the **Distribution** drop-down menu as is typical for this type of analysis.
   Enter the hazard function from <TableReference parentDocId="105_1_0" tableKey="example-1-stage-frequency"/> by copying and pating into the table as indicated
   in <FigureReference parentDocId="105_1_0" figKey="example-1-tabular-hazard"/>(c).
