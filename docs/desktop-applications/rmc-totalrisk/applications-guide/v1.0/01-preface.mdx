# Preface

The purpose of this RMC-TotalRisk Applications Guide is to demonstrate how to use the software for performing risk analysis calculations in scenarios
commonly encountered in risk assessments of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) dams. This guide does not aim to explain the fundamental concepts of
risk analysis or the USACE dam safety risk management framework. It is intended for readers who already possess an expert-level understanding of risk
analysis, risk management, event tree analysis, risk tolerability, uncertainty analysis, probability theory, and statistics within the context of dam
safety risk analysis.
