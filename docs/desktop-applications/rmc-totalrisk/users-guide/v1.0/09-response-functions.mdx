# System Response Functions

System response functions specify how a system responds to a given hazard. In RMC-TotalRisk, a system response function defines the conditional
probability of failure for various hazard levels, such as WSEs.

In dam and levee safety risk analyses, analysts develop system response functions for multiple potential failure modes (PFMs). Common PFMs include
seepage and piping, erosion and bank caving, and overtopping. Each PFM may result in different consequence outcomes, so analysts should keep PFMs
distinct in a risk analysis.

RMC-TotalRisk allows users to define system response functions using an event tree, parametric function, tabular function, bivariate tabular function,
or a composite of multiple functions. The following subsections describe each input option in detail.

## Event Tree Response Function

Event tree analyses (ETAs) represent the logic of how an initiating event, like a flood or earthquake, can lead to various types of damage and
failure <Citation citationKey="BestPractices" />. An event tree consists of a sequence of interconnected nodes and branches <Citation citationKey="HartfordBaecher" />.
Each node corresponds to an uncertain event (e.g., a crack forming in an embankment) or an uncertain state of nature (e.g., the existence of
adversely oriented joint planes). Branches originating from a node represent the possible events or states of nature that could occur. Probabilities
are assigned to each node to quantify the likelihood of each event or condition, conditional on the occurrence of all preceding events in the tree.
For more details on event tree calculations in RMC-TotalRisk, refer to <Citation citationKey="TechRef" />.

To create an event tree response function, right-click on the **System Responses** folder in the Project Explorer (<FigReference figKey="event-tree-create" />)
or navigate to **Project Menu > System Responses** and select **Add Event Tree Response…**. A dialog will appear, prompting you to enter the dataset
name and select an event tree template to import. This example uses the Basic template to demonstrate how to build an event tree from scratch, but
you can also choose from a variety of default or user-defined templates.

<Figure

src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure84.png"
alt="The Add Event Tree Response option under the right-click menu of System Responses on the left, and the event tree response function dialog box 
  on the right allowing the user to enter the name of the response function and select a template from a dropdown."
caption="Create new event tree response function."
/>

After creating the new event tree response function, the Tabbed Documents area automatically opens, and the Properties window displays the event tree
properties (<FigReference figKey="event-tree-properties" />). In the Properties window, you can configure the name, description, hazard type, hazard
units, hazard interpolation, probability interpolation, and selected event tree node properties. The interpolation transforms define how the data is
interpolated when sampling values between hazard levels.

<Figure
figKey="event-tree-properties"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure85.png"
alt="The properties window includes two tabs General and Options. The General tab displays the event tree properties, dropdown selections for hazard and 
  probability interpolations and the selected branch properties."
caption="Event tree response function properties."
/>

### Terminology

This section defines RMC-TotalRisk’s event tree terminology <Citation citationKey="TechRef" />.

- **Node**: Represents a branching point in the event tree, signifying a random event or state. Event trees include four types of nodes:

  - <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/hazardnode.png"/> **Initiating Hazard Node**: Always the first node in 
the event tree. This node defines the hazard levels and links system response probabilities to the hazard function. Enter only hazard levels for 
this node, not hazard exceedance probabilities. To improve the accuracy of dam and levee risk assessments, define at least five hazard levels. Start 
with a hazard level with a near-zero probability of failure and progress to a level exceeding the crest height. Include intermediate levels with 
critical features or inflection points, such as the normal pool or the spillway invert for dams.

  - <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/chancenode.png"/> **Chance Node**: Represents the probability of an 
event occurring at each hazard level defined in the initiating hazard node. You can define probabilities as a single value for all hazard levels 
(single value), as unique values for each hazard level (multi-value), or by referencing another source (see “reference node”).

  - <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/referencenode.png"/> **Reference Node**: Functions like a chance node 
but pulls probabilities from a previously defined response function or node in the event tree instead of defining them directly at the node.

  - <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/remaindernode.png"/> **Remainder Node**: Represents the probability 
remaining after accounting for all other chance and reference node probabilities at the current branching point. For example, if an event has 
two potential outcomes, the remainder node accounts for the probability that neither outcome occurs. The software computes the remainder probability 
automatically; users cannot modify it.

- **Branch**: The line connecting two nodes in the event tree.

- **End Node**: A node with no downstream branches, representing the final state in a sequence of events. This is also called a leaf node or terminal node.

- **Pathway**: A unique sequence of events representing a potential failure progression. The probability of a pathway equals the joint probability
  of all nodes in the series from the initiating hazard node to the end node. This is also referred to as a path, sequence, connection, or root-to-node.

- **Upstream Nodes**: Nodes located to the left of a selected node in the tree. These nodes must occur before the selected node’s event. Upstream
  nodes are also called parent nodes, conditional events, or preceding nodes.

- **Downstream Nodes**: Nodes located to the right of a selected node in the tree. These nodes occur after the selected node’s event. Downstream nodes
  are also called child nodes, conditional events, proceeding nodes, or subsequent nodes.

- **Node Probability**: Represents the probability of the selected node event occurring, conditioned on the occurrence of all upstream nodes.

- **Event Likelihood**: Represents the probability of a node event occurring at a given hazard level. This is the joint probability of the selected
  node event and all its upstream nodes.

### Navigating an Event Tree

You can move the event tree around the workspace by clicking and dragging the background canvas... When you hover over a node, a toolbar appears above
it, as shown in <FigReference figKey="node-toolbar" />.

### Customizing an Event Tree

The **Options** tab in the event tree Properties window provides tools to customize your event tree’s appearance and layout (<FigReference figKey="event-tree-options" />).

<Figure
figKey="event-tree-options"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure88.png"
alt="The General tab of the properties window displays the event tree style options to change height, width, and color to customize event tree. There 
  is a Reset button to restore options to default settings. There is also an option to change zoom scale."
caption="Event tree style options."
/>

### Building an Event Tree

This example demonstrates how to build an event tree for spillway erosion. The sequence of events includes: pool elevation results in spillway flow, grass erodes
from the spillway, headcut initiates, headcut advances to the control section, control structure fails, unsuccessful intervention, and breach.

1. **Define the hazard**. Select the initiating hazard node branch, **Hazard**, by clicking on it. Once selected, edit its properties in the Properties window
   under the Selected Branch Properties subsection (<FigReference figKey="edit-node-properties" />). Alternatively, click the **Branch Properties**
   button <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/branchproperties.png" /> in the event tree node toolbar to edit the branch.
   Rename the branch to “Pool Elevation.”

<Figure  
figKey="edit-node-properties"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure89.png"  
alt="Displays properties popup window from the node tool bar icon on the left, and the event tree properties window on the right. The node properties can be edited 
  from either of these two options."  
caption="Edit the node properties from either the node toolbar or Properties window."  
/>

2.  **Enter hazard levels**. Use the table editing tools to input the desired hazard levels.

3.  **Delete the default chance node**. Remove the chance node added by default by clicking the delete
    button <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/deletebranch.png" /> in the toolbar, or by using the **Sub-Branches Properties**
    section of the initiating hazard node. Confirm the deletion when prompted by clicking **Yes**.

4.  **Add a new node**. Add the next node in the event tree using one of the following methods: Click the **Add New Branch**
    button <FigureInline src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/newbranch.png" /> in the node toolbar, use the right-click node context menu on
    the node, or navigate to the **Sub-Branches Properties** section in the Properties window. After adding the node, use the **Node Properties Editor** to rename it,
    add a description, and define the event's probability for each hazard level specified in step 1 (<FigReference figKey="grass-removal-props" />).

<Figure  
figKey="grass-removal-props"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure90.png"  
alt="Displays property popup window for Grass Removal node from the node tool bar icon. The window displays text boxes for name, and description; drop-downs for 
  selecting the system response’s source and distribution, as well as the system response table at the bottom."  
caption="Properties for the Grass Removal probability event tree node."  
/>

5. **Complete the event tree**. Continue adding nodes and defining their properties until the event tree is fully developed (<FigReference figKey="completed-event-tree" />).

<Figure  
figKey="completed-event-tree"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure91.png"  
alt="Displays completed event tree with Pool Elevation as the initiating hazard node; Grass Removal, Head-cut initiation, Advancement, Failure of control structure, 
  Unsuccessful intervention, and Breach chance nodes, and the corresponding remainder nodes."  
caption="Completed spillway erosion event tree."  
/>

### Exploring Event Tree Results

The Tabbed Document contains three tabs: **Event Tree**, **Response**, and **Diagnostics**, each offering tools to explore the event tree analysis results.

- The **Event Tree** is used to build and edit the event tree, as described in earlier sections.

- The **Response** tab displays a graphical representation of the system response function for each hazard level (<FigReference figKey="fragility-curve" />). This
  function, commonly referred to as a fragility curve, represents the probability of failure for each defined hazard level. You can export the function data as tabular
  data using the **Export Plot Data** button.

<Figure  
figKey="fragility-curve"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure92.png"  
alt="A graphical representation of the system response function displaying mean and 90% confidence interval with Stage in ft on the x-axis and Conditional probability 
  of failure on the y-axis."  
caption="System response probability function result from event tree."  
/>

- The **Diagnostics** tab provides tools for reviewing and validating the event tree calculations. The left side of the Diagnostics tab offers options for **Node Filters**,
  **Model Parameters**, and **Plot Options** (<FigReference figKey="diagnostic-options" />). Details for each option are provided below.

<Figure  
figKey="diagnostic-options"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure93.png"  
alt="Displays Node filters check boxes; text box and drop downs for model parameters, and radio buttons for selecting plot options."  
caption="Event tree diagnostic viewing options."  
/>

#### Node Filters

- **Show Remainder Nodes**: Toggles the display of remainder nodes in the results.
- **Combine Remainder Leaves**: Combines terminal remainder nodes, which often represent non-failure conditions, into a single result.
- **Leaf Nodes Only**: Displays only terminal leaf nodes (nodes without child branches).

#### Model Parameters

- **Monte Carlo Iterations**: Specifies the number of Monte Carlo iterations used to sample the event tree for diagnostic analysis. This option is disabled if
  no uncertainty is present.
- **Hazard Level**: Defines the hazard level used to calculate diagnostic results.

#### Plot Options

- **Event Likelihood**: Displays a box-and-whisker plot of the likelihood for each node occurring at the selected hazard level (<FigReference figKey="event-likelihood-plot" />).

<Figure  
figKey="event-likelihood-plot"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure94.png"  
alt="A box-and-whisker plot displaying the likelihood on the x-axis, and each node of the event tree on the y-axis. With likelihoods of Grass removal and Head-cut 
  initiation as almost certain, and likelihood of breach under 0.3."  
caption="Event tree diagnostics event likelihood plot option."  
/>

- **Correlation to SRP**: Shows Pearson correlation coefficients for how node probabilities correlate with overall SRP. The nodal correlations to SRP display as a
  ranked tornado plot (<FigReference figKey="correlation-to-srp" />).

<Figure  
figKey="correlation-to-srp"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure95.png"  
alt="A ranked tornado plot displaying correlation coefficients on the x-axis and the nodes on the y-axis. The failure of control structure and head-cut advances have 
  the highest correlation, and the Grass removal and Head-cut initiates have the lowest correlation to the overall SRP."  
caption="Event tree diagnostics tree node correlation to SRP plot."  
/>

- **Sensitivity Index**: Displays each node’s first-order sensitivity index, indicating its contribution to variance in SRP (<FigReference figKey="sensitivity-indices" />).

<Figure  
figKey="sensitivity-indices"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure96.png"  
alt="Displaying sensitivity index on the x-axis and the nodes on the y-axis. The failure of control structure and head-cut advances have the highest sensitivity indices, 
  and the Grass removal and Head-cut initiates have the lowest sensitivity indices."  
caption="Event tree diagnostics tree node sensitivity indices."  
/>

- **Node SRP Scatter**: Plots sampled probabilities of a node against overall SRP for each Monte Carlo iteration (<FigReference figKey="srp-scatter" />).

<Figure  
figKey="srp-scatter"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure97.png"  
alt="A scatter plot for Failure of Control Structure node showing a clear positive trend between the sampled node probability and the overall SRP."  
caption="Event tree diagnostics tree node probability to SRP scatter plot."  
/>

- **Tabular**: Displays a table of node probabilities and the overall SRP for each Monte Carlo iteration (<FigReference figKey="tabular-output" />). Use the table's
  column statistics feature to verify sampling distributions (<FigReference figKey="column-stats" />).

<Figure  
figKey="tabular-output"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure98.png"  
alt="A table showing each of the individual node’s sampled probabilities and overall SRP for each Monte Carlo iteration in the model."

alt="A triangular histogram plot. Decorative."  
caption="Column statistics for the Unsuccessful Interventions node’s sampled probabilities, confirming that the node distribution (triangular) is being sampled correctly."  
/>

## Parametric Response Function

This option enables you to define a system response function using a parametric distribution.

To create a parametric response function, right-click on the **System Responses** folder in the Project Explorer (<FigReference figKey="add-parametric" />) or go to
**Project Menu > System Responses** and select **Add Parametric Response…**. Enter a name for the parametric response function and click **OK**.

<Figure  
figKey="add-parametric"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure100.png"  
alt="The Add Parametric Response option under the right-click menu of System Responses on the left, and the Parametric Response function dialog box on the right 
  allowing the user to enter the name of the response function."  
caption="Create new parametric response function."  
/>

After creating the parametric response function, the system automatically opens it in the Tabbed Documents area, and the Properties window displays its properties
(<FigReference figKey="parametric-properties" />). In the Properties window, you can set the name, description, hazard type, and hazard units. Define the parametric
distribution by setting the ERL, type of distribution, and parameters for the distribution. Once the parameters have been set, click the **Compute** button to
generate and view the parametric response function.

<Figure  
figKey="parametric-properties"  
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure101.png"  
alt="Displays the Distribution section of the parametric response function properties window to define the parametric distribution. There are buttons to compute the 
  parametric hazard function and to perform bootstrap analysis at the bottom of the window."  
caption="Parametric response function properties."  
/>

Additional options for computing the parametric function are available in the Options tab on the Properties window. These include bootstrap sampling, confidence
intervals, the number of realizations, a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) seed for random number generation, and output probability ordinates.

Similar to RMC-BestFit, RMC-RFA, and parametric hazard functions, you can view frequency results in graphical or tabular form. For more information on these viewing
options, refer to the [Import from RMC-BestFit](/docs/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/hazard-functions/#import-from-rmc-bestfit) section of the Hazard
Functions chapter.

## Tabular Response Function

This option allows you to define a system response function using tabular data. The most common use case involves copying and pasting data from another application,
such as Microsoft Excel.

To create a tabular response function, right-click on the **System Responses folder** in the Project Explorer (<FigReference figKey="create-tabular" />) or go to
**Project Menu > System Responses** and select **Add Tabular Response…**. Enter a name for the tabular response function and click **OK**.

<Figure
figKey="create-tabular"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure102.png"
alt="The Add Tabular Response option under the right-click menu of System Responses on the left, and the Tabular Response function dialog box on the right allowing 
  the user to enter the name of the response function."
caption="Create new tabular response function."
/>

Once you create the tabular response function, the system automatically opens it in the Tabbed Documents area, and the Properties window displays the tabular
function's properties (<FigReference figKey="tabular-properties" />). In the Properties window, you can configure the name, description, hazard type, hazard units,
and hazard and probability interpolation transforms. The interpolation transforms define how the data is interpolated when sampling values between the specified
tabular ordinates.

<Figure
figKey="tabular-properties"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure103.png"
alt="The Tabular Response properties window displaying name, description, created on and last modified dates, hazard type, hazard units, and interpolation transforms."
caption="Tabular response function properties."
/>

The Tabbed Document for a tabular response function includes a table for data entry and a graphical representation of the data (<FigReference figKey="tabular-example" />).
Select a distribution to define uncertainty and enter the parameters for the selected distribution at each ordinate in the tabular data. You can input data manually
into the table or paste it from an external source, such as Microsoft Excel.

<Figure
figKey="tabular-example"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure104.png"
alt="Displays the tabular response function table using PERT distribution selection from dropdown on the left and the corresponding graph with mean, median, and 90% 
  confidence interval on the right with Stage in ft on the x-axis and Conditional probability of failure on the y-axis."
caption="Tabular response function example."
/>

### Data Validation

The input data table has built-in validation. Tabular data must meet the following requirements:

- The hazard values must be in ascending order.
- The probability values must be between 0 and 1.
- If uncertainty is defined, the uncertain ordinates must contain valid distribution parameters.

If you enter invalid data, the corresponding table cell turns red, and a tooltip explains the error, as shown in <FigReference figKey="tabular-validation" />.
In addition, an error message appears in the Message window prompting you to resolve all errors in the data table.

<Figure
figKey="tabular-validation"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure105.png"
alt="The stage-response probability input data table with invalid data cells turned red, and a tooltip displaying the source of the error."
caption="Tabular response function input data validation."
/>

## Bivariate Response Function

This option enables you to define a system response function that depends on two hazards using tabular data.

To create a bivariate response function, right-click on the **System Responses** folder in the Project Explorer (<FigReference figKey="create-bivariate" />) or
go to **Project Menu > System Responses** and select **Add Bivariate Response…**. Enter a name for the bivariate response function and click **OK**.

<Figure
figKey="create-bivariate"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure106.png"
alt="The Add Bivariate Response option under the right-click menu of System Responses on the left, and the Bivariate Response function dialog box on the right 
  allowing the user to enter the name of the response function."
caption="Create new bivariate response function."
/>

When you create the bivariate response function, it automatically opens in the Tabbed Documents area, and the Properties window displays its properties
(<FigReference figKey="bivariate-properties" />). From the Properties window, you can configure the name, description, primary hazard, primary hazard units,
and the interpolation transforms for the primary hazard and probabilities.

Use the table tools to add the desired hazard levels for both the primary and secondary hazards, ensuring that all hazard levels are in ascending order. Assign
a weight to each secondary hazard level. These weights are used during the risk computation to estimate the total system response probability for each primary
hazard level. The weights must sum to 1. You can enter the weights manually or calculate them using a specified hazard function. For more details on bivariate
hazard properties, refer to <Citation citationKey="TechRef" />.

<Figure
figKey="bivariate-properties"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure107.png"
alt="Displaying the primary hazard levels and the secondary hazard levels of the Bivariate Response function Properties window with Primary hazard levels 
  specified as Stage, and the secondary hazard specified as PGA-Frequency. There is a check box for manually entering the weights."
caption="Bivariate response function properties."
/>

As you input primary and secondary hazard levels in the Properties window, the table at the top of the Tabbed Document automatically updates, with each row
representing a primary hazard level and each column representing a secondary hazard level (<FigReference figKey="bivariate-display" />). To complete the bivariate
response function, enter the probability of failure in each cell based on the combination of the primary hazard (row) and secondary hazard (column). A graphical
representation of the system response functions for each secondary hazard level appears below the table.

<Figure
figKey="bivariate-display"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure108.png"
alt="Displays a table with the primary hazard levels in rows and the secondary hazard levels in columns. The plot below has lines corresponding to each secondary 
  hazard level as well as a weighted line. The primary hazard, Stage in ft is on the x-axis and Conditional probability of failure on the y-axis."
caption="Bivariate response function graphical display."
/>

## Composite Response Function

This option allows you to combine multiple response functions into a single function by assigning weights to the individual input functions.

To create a composite response function, right-click on the **System Responses** folder in the Project Explorer (<FigReference figKey="create-composite" />)
or navigate to **Project Menu > Hazards** and **select Add Composite Response…**. Enter a name for the composite response function and click **OK**.

<Figure
figKey="create-composite"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure109.png"
alt="The Add Composite Response option under the right-click menu of System Responses on the left, and the Composite Response function dialog box on the right 
allowing the user to enter the name of the response function."
caption="Create new composite response function."
/>

After creating the composite response function, it automatically opens in the Tabbed Documents area, and the Properties window displays its properties
(<FigReference figKey="composite-properties" />). In the Properties window, you can configure the name, description, hazard type, hazard units, and input response
functions. Use the Response Functions table to define the input functions. Click the Add Row(s) button in the table toolbar to add rows for the input functions.
Ensure that the response function weights sum to 1. If the system response functions are competing, uncheck the **Is Mixture** checkbox and select a **Dependency**
type: Independent, Perfectly Positive, or Perfectly Negative.

<Figure
figKey="composite-properties"
src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/figure110.png"
alt="Displays the Response Function section of the Composite response function properties window with a check box for Is Mixture and dropdowns for selecting 
  response function levels and corresponding text boxes for entering the weights for each level of the response function."
