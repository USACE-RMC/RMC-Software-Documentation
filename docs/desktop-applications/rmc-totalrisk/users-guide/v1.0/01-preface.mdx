# Preface

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers TotalRisk software (RMC-TotalRisk) performs quantitative risk calculations for a system from a set of hazard,
transform, system response, and consequence functions. RMC-TotalRisk is part of an integrated software suite that supports risk assessments.
The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry, report quality charts, and
diagnostic tools. RMC-TotalRisk can evaluate risk for a single component with multiple failure modes and a complex system comprised of multiple
components. This document is a guide for developing a quantitative risk analysis with RMC-TotalRisk.
