# Graphical User Interface

RMC-TotalRisk is a menu-driven software package that performs risk analyses. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface,
data entry capabilities, multi-failure risk analysis, and report-quality charts.

The graphical user interface consists of a menu bar, tool bar, and four window panes (<FigReference figKey="gui-overview" />): the Project Explorer, Tabbed Documents, Properties,
and the Message window. You may move, dock, hide, or close the panes as desired.

<Figure

  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure4.png"
  alt="The full graphical user interface of RMC-TotalRisk, including the project explorer (left), tabbed documents (center), properties (right), and message window (bottom)."
  caption="RMC-TotalRisk graphical user interface."
/>

## Menu Bar

The menu bar at the top of the window (<FigReference figKey="menu-bar" />) contains important commands for working with RMC TotalRisk. The following subsections provide detail on
each command.

<Figure
  figKey="menu-bar"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure5.png"
  alt="The menu bar with important commands horizontally displayed as File, View, Project, Tools, Window, and Help."
  caption="RMC-TotalRisk menu bar."
/>

### File

The File menu (<FigReference figKey="file-menu" />) provides essential file management functionality. From this menu, you create a new project, open an existing project, save or
save as, open recent projects, or exit the application.

<Figure
  figKey="file-menu"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure6.png"
  alt="The file menu drop-down with new, open, save, save as, and recent project options."
  caption="File menu."
/>

The first time you use RMC-TotalRisk, the recent projects list will be empty. If your recent projects exceed the number that the list shows at one time (the default is 10), a
menu item labeled **More Files…** is available. That option opens a Recent Files dialog showing all available recent project files (<FigReference figKey="recent-files" />). From
here, you may open any recently used project file or clear the recent project file list.

<Figure
  figKey="recent-files"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure7.png"
  alt="The recent file dialog lists all recent files vertically in a scrollable list."
  caption="Recent file dialog."
/>

### View

You may move, dock, hide, or close the Project Explorer, the Properties window, and Message window as desired. The View menu (<FigReference figKey="view-menu" />) allows you to
unhide or open these windows. In addition, you can restore the default layout of the panes.

<Figure
  figKey="view-menu"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure8.png"
  alt="The view menu drop-down with options to view the project explorer, message window, properties window, all windows, and restore default layout."
  caption="View menu."
/>

### Project

The Project menu (<FigReference figKey="project-menu" />) contains commands related to the project you are working in. From this menu, you can create a new hazard, transform,
system response, or consequence function. You can also add a new risk analysis. In addition, you can edit the project properties through the Properties window.

<Figure
  figKey="project-menu"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure9.png"
  alt="The project menu drop-down with options to create input functions, create a risk analysis, and edit the project properties."
  caption="Project menu."
/>

### Tools

The Tools menu (<FigReference figKey="tools-menu" />) provides tools for managing your project and personalizing your workspace.

<Figure
  figKey="tools-menu"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure10.png"
  alt="The tools menu drop-down with showing several options to manage your project, including creating a batch run and setting the software options."
  caption="Tools menu."
/>

- **Compact & Optimize Project File** compacts and optimizes the project database and removes unnecessary tables. This tool can significantly reduce the size of your file without
  losing any project data.

- **Zip Project File** zips your project file and prompts you to save the .zip to a location on your computer. The zip file is smaller and easier to share with others.

- **Restore From Backup** restores the project from the backup file (\*\*\*.tra.bak). Note: RMC-TotalRisk creates a backup file every 30 minutes by default. You can change the backup
  frequency in the Options dialog, File Management tab.

- **Equivalent Annual Consequences** (<FigReference figKey="eqac-tool" />) calculates equivalent annual consequences (EqAC) between two risk analyses. EqAC is required in USACE
  cost evaluation procedures <Citation citationKey="TechRef" />. The EqAC is automatically calculated when you define the analysis period (in years) and a discount rate (as a
  percentage), then select current and future risk analyses and the year those results represent. Use the table tools to add and remove EqAC calculations. You can also manually enter
  base and future plan results by clicking in the dropdowns and typing the value.

<Figure

  alt="The equivalent annual consequences tool dialog showing a comparison of four design plans with a 50-year lifecycle."
  caption="Equivalent Annual Consequences tool."
/>

- **Batch Run** (<FigReference figKey="batch-run" />) simulates multiple risk analyses as a batch process. Batch processing is very useful when inputs have been changed that are
  common across multiple risk analyses.

<Figure
  figKey="batch-run"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure12.png"
  alt="The batch run dialog lists all the risk analyses vertically in a scrollable list. Multiple analyses can be selected and run."
  caption="Batch Run Risk Analyses tool."
/>

- **Options** lets you customize the application, file management, Message window, and default settings. See [Personalize RMC-TotalRisk](#personalize-rmc-totalrisk) for more details.

### Window

The Window menu allows you to close or activate document windows. The active window has a check mark next to it, as shown in (<FigReference figKey="window-menu" />).

<Figure
  figKey="window-menu"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure13.png"
  alt="The window menu drop-down with options to close all documents and options to manage all open windows."
  caption="Window menu."
/>

You can see all open windows by clicking **Windows…**, which opens a Windows dialog (<FigReference figKey="windows-dialog" />). From here, you can activate or save specific
document windows. In addition, you can select and close multiple windows at once.

<Figure
  figKey="windows-dialog"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure14.png"
  alt="The windows dialog lists all open windows vertically in a scrollable list."
  caption="Windows dialog."
/>

### Help

From the Help menu, you can access this User's Guide (<FigReference figKey="help-menu"/>), view the Terms and Conditions for Use, or view the About RMC-TotalRisk splash
screen (<FigReference figKey="about-splash-screen"/>).

<Figure
  figKey="help-menu"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure15.png"
  alt="The help menu drop-down with options to open the user guide, terms and conditions for use, and the about splash screen."

  alt="The about splash screen showing the software icon, version number, and contact information."
  caption="About RMC-TotalRisk splash screen."
/>

## Tool Bar

The Tool Bar is on the main window, below the Menu Bar, with buttons for frequently used options under the File menu: New Project, Open Project, and Save
Project (<FigReference figKey="tool-bar"/>).

<Figure
  figKey="tool-bar"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure17.png"
  alt="The tool bar with new, open, and save project commands displayed horizontally below the menu bar."
  caption="RMC-TotalRisk tool bar."
/>

## Window Layout

In RMC-TotalRisk, you can customize the position, size, and behavior of windows to create layouts that work best for you. When you customize the layout, RMC-TotalRisk
remembers the configuration. For example, if you change the docking location of the Project Explorer and then close RMC-TotalRisk, the next time that you open the software,
the Project Explorer is docked in that same location.

### Types of Windows

RMC-TotalRisk has four basic window types: the Project Explorer, Tabbed Documents, Properties, and the Message Window (<FigReference figKey="gui-overview"/>). These
windows provide editing and reviewing space for the various project components, including hazard, response, and consequence functions. For tool windows, resize and
drag them by their title bars. For document windows, drag them by their tabs.

On the title bars in the Project Explorer, Properties window, and Message Window, a dropdown offers other options (<FigReference figKey="window-options"/>).

<Figure
  figKey="window-options"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure18.png"
  alt="The tool window title bar drop-down showing options to float or hide the window."
  caption="Tools window options."
/>

On the Tabbed Documents pane, you can right-click on document tabs to set other options on the window. These options include docking, floating, and hiding
windows (<FigReference figKey="doc-window-options"/>).

<Figure
  figKey="doc-window-options"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure19.png"
  alt="The document window drop-down showing several options to close, float, and create new horizontal or vertical tab groups."
  caption="Document window options."
/>

### Tab Groups

When you are working with two or more open documents in RMC-TotalRisk, you can group tabbed documents to enhance your ability to manage a limited workspace. Organize
multiple document and tool windows into either vertical or horizontal tab groups or move documents from one group to another by dragging and dropping them; even
float and move windows and tab groups to different monitors. When you need to view or edit two documents at once, you can split windows by creating two horizontal
tab groups, as shown in <FigReference figKey="split-doc-windows"/>.

<Figure
  figKey="split-doc-windows"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure20.png"
  alt="The tabbed document windows are split horizontally displaying separate inputs on the left and the right of the screen."
  caption="Split document windows."
/>

### Move and Dock Windows

You can dock a document window in the Tabbed Documents area or float it as a separate window independent of the main window. You can arrange windows in the following ways:

- Dock tool windows to the edge of the main window frame.
- Float tool and document windows over or outside the main window.
- Hide tool windows along the edge of the main window.
- Display windows on different monitors.
- Reset window placement to the default layout by choosing **View > Reset Default Layout**.

Arrange windows by dragging or right-clicking the title bar or tab of the window being arranged. When you click and drag the title bar of a tool window or the tab of
a document window, a cross-shaped window placement guide appears. During the drag operation, when the cursor is over one of the arrows in the guide, a shaded area
appears that shows you where the window docks if you release the mouse button. <FigReference figKey="move-doc-window"/> and <FigReference figKey="dock-properties-window"/>
show examples of the window placement guide.

<Figure
  figKey="move-doc-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure21.png"
  alt="The tabbed document is being moved and relocated using the placement guide."

/>

<Figure
  figKey="dock-properties-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure22.png"
  alt="The document is being docked into a new location using the placement guide."
  caption="Docking the Properties window below the Project Explorer."
/>

### Close and Auto-Hide Tool Windows

You can close a tool window by clicking on the X in the upper right of the title bar. To reopen the tool window, navigate to the View menu and select the desired tool
window to show. Tool windows have an auto-hide feature, which causes a window to slide out of the way when you use a different window. When a window is auto-hidden,
the window name appears on the tab at the edge of the main window, as shown in <FigReference figKey="auto-hide-tool-window"/>. To show the window again, move your mouse
cursor over the tab and the window slides back into view.

<Figure
  figKey="auto-hide-tool-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure23.png"
  alt="Clicking the auto hide pin moves the tool window and hides it on the right side of the screen."
  caption="Auto-Hide tool window."
/>

## Project Explorer

The Project Explorer, typically on the left-hand side of the main window, shows a graphical representation of the hierarchy of elements within your
project (<FigReference figKey="project-explorer"/>). After you create a new project, you can use the Project Explorer to view, navigate, and manage the project elements.

<Figure
  figKey="project-explorer"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure24.png"
  alt="The project explorer located on the left of the screen showing folders for the project elements, such as hazards, transforms, system responses, consequences, and risk analyses."
  caption="Project Explorer."
/>

Project elements are organized under folder headers: Hazards, Transforms, System Responses, Consequences, and Risk Analyses.

Many menu commands are available by right-clicking on various items in the Project Explorer. You can create new elements, create groups, or sort the items in each
folder by right-clicking the folder icon or name (<FigReference figKey="project-explorer-menu"/>).

<Figure
  figKey="project-explorer-menu"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure25.png"
  alt="The hazards folder is right-clicked to display the context menu with several options such as creating a new folder group."
  caption="Example of a menu available by right-clicking on a Project Explorer folder header."
/>

When right-clicking an individual project element, the following commands are available: Edit, Copy, Rename, Delete, Move Up, and Move
Down (<FigReference figKey="project-element-menu-single"/>, left side). When multiple project elements are selected, three right-click menu commands are available: Group,
Edit, and Delete (<FigReference figKey="project-element-menu-single"/>, right side). Double-clicking a project element opens it for editing.

<Figure
  figKey="project-element-menu-single"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure26.png"
  alt="Different context menu options are available when clicking on single selections or multiple selections."
  caption="Examples of menu options available by right-clicking on project elements: for a single selection (left) or multiple selections (right)."
  outWidth="95%"
/>

You can move individual project elements by left-clicking, holding, and dragging the element. A horizontal line indicates where the element will move
to (<FigReference figKey="drag-drop-project-element"/>). You can also drag and drop input data from one RMC-TotalRisk project to another.

<Figure
  figKey="drag-drop-project-element"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure27.png"
  alt="The tabular hazard is being dragged upward and dropped at a higher location aided by a horizontal line."
  caption="Project Explorer element drag and drop."
/>

Grouping provides a way to manage the Project Explorer by consolidating project elements into subgroups. When right-clicking a group element, all commands from the root
folder are available, as well as Ungroup and Rename (<FigReference figKey="group-elements"/>).

<Figure
  figKey="group-elements"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure28.png"
  alt="Right-clicking a group header provides several options, such as ungrouping all the elements."
  caption="Project Explorer group elements."
/>

## Tabbed Documents

In RMC-TotalRisk, document windows contain the project element data, such as input tabular data, event trees, and risk analyses. Opening a project
element for editing automatically opens the Tabbed Document pane, which is typically in the center of the main window (see <FigReference figKey="tabbed-documents" />).
You can reorder the tabbed documents or drag or float them outside of the main window. When you click on, or activate, a document window, the
Properties window shows the associated project element properties.

<Figure
  figKey="tabbed-documents"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure29.png"
  alt="The tabbed documents have tabbed headers horizontally located at the top of the document pane."
  caption="Tabbed Document pane."
/>

## Properties Window

The Properties window, typically on the right-hand side of the main window, displays the properties for the project and selected project elements.
To access the element properties, open the element for edit. Some properties are common to all project elements, such as name and description,
while others are unique to the specific elements. Properties are organized into groups for easier navigation. When you click on a property, the
property description displays at the bottom of the Properties window, as shown in <FigReference figKey="properties-window" />. All analyses run
from the Properties window.

<Figure
  figKey="properties-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure30.png"
  alt="The properties window contains all the key properties and inputs for the project elements."
  caption="Properties window."
/>

## Message Window

The Message window (<FigReference figKey="message-window" />) shows you errors, warnings, messages, and event logs regarding the current state of
your project. If your project file has any errors, they are listed here. The Message window lets you perform the following tasks:

- Display the errors, warnings, messages, and events produced while you work in RMC-TotalRisk.
- Double-click any error message entry to open the project element where the problem occurs.
- Filter the types of entries that the Message window displays by clicking on the tabs. The default is to only display errors and warnings.
- Export all entries to a text file.

Once you resolve an error, warning, or message, the entry disappears from the Message window. You may customize the font color of the various message
types by navigating to **Tools > Options**. See section [Personalize RMC-TotalRisk](#personalize-rmc-totalrisk) for more details.

<Figure
  figKey="message-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure31.png"
  alt="The message window showing one error message in red and one warning message in orange."
  caption="Message window."
/>

## Personalize RMC-TotalRisk

You can personalize RMC-TotalRisk in various ways to enhance the user experience by navigating to **Tools > Options**. The Options dialog
allows you to customize the application, file management, Message Window, and default settings.

### Application Options

You can set the application color theme to the Light or Blue theme, as shown in <FigReference figKey="light-theme" /> and <FigReference figKey="blue-theme" />.
The default is the Light theme. If you select **Save the window docking layout on close**, RMC-TotalRisk remembers it when you reopen the
application. You can also set the number of window items in the Window menu and the number of recent project items in the Recent Project list
under the File menu.

<Figure
  figKey="light-theme"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure32.png"
  alt="Application options with the light color theme selected. Other options are shown for managing the docking layout and recent file list."

  alt="Application options with the blue color theme selected. Other options are shown for managing the docking layout and recent file list."
  caption="Options dialog with blue color theme."
/>

### File Management Options

RMC-TotalRisk project files are saved as SQLite databases. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is a self-contained, high-reliability, SQL database
engine, which is also one of the most used database engines in the world. Database files can grow quickly as you use them, sometimes hindering
performance. They can also occasionally become corrupt or damaged. Under Tools, select **Compact & Optimize Project File** to prevent or fix these
problems. You can also set RMC-TotalRisk to **Compact & optimize project file on close** by checking the checkbox.

You can set the time interval in which a project backup file is created (<FigReference figKey="file-management" />). A file with the extension
.bak is automatically created when a project is opened. If the project closes successfully, then the .bak file is deleted. On occasion, if the
database file is damaged or corrupted, or the system closes unexpectedly causing you to lose important data, you might need to restore the project
from a backup file by selecting **Tools > Restore from Backup** (<FigReference figKey="restore-backup" />).

<Figure
  figKey="file-management"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure34.png"

  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure35.png"
  alt="The tool menu drop-down with the restore from backup option selected."
  caption="Restore from backup."
/>

### Message Window Options

You can adjust the auditory and visual settings for the Message window. You can turn message beeps on or off and select the font color for the
different message types, as shown in <FigReference figKey="message-options" />.

<Figure
  figKey="message-options"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-totalrisk/users-guide/v1.0/figure36.png"
  alt="The message window options to set the sound effects and colors of the message types."
  caption="Message window options."
/>

### Default Options

You can set the default project location directory and the default number of decimal digits for the project inputs and outputs
(<FigReference figKey="default-options" />). In addition, you can set the default hazard type and units for each input function category. For
example, by default, when you create a new hazard function, the hazard type and unit are automatically set to Stage and ft, respectively.

If the desired hazard type or unit is missing, click the “plus” button to add a new option. If you want to delete an option, click the **X**
that appears by that option inside the dropdown.

### Table Column Features

- **Sort and Search**: Sort and search table columns. For numeric values in output tables, you can also generate summary statistics
  (<FigReference figKey="sort-and-search"/>). Sort by right-clicking on a column header and selecting the desired sort option or by double clicking
  on the column header to sort. Note: Double-clicking a column header that is already sorted sorts it in the opposite order.
