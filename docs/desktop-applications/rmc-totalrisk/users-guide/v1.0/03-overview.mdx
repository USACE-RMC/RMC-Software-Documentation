# Risk Analysis Framework

In RMC-TotalRisk, a risk analysis computes the risk associated with a collection of potential failure modes for each system component. A failure mode consists
of three key inputs: a hazard, the systemâ€™s response to the hazard, and the consequences of that response. A non-failure mode, on the other hand, includes the
hazard and the associated non-failure consequences.

A risk analysis uses four types of functions as inputs:

- **Hazard Function**: Commonly called a frequency curve, this function describes the exceedance probabilities of various hazard levels. Examples include annual
  maximum peak flow frequency, peak reservoir pool stage frequency, and peak ground acceleration.
- **Transform Function**: This function converts hazard levels from one type to another. For example, a peak flow-frequency function can be transformed into a
  stage-frequency function using a flow-to-stage rating curve. Transform functions are optional.
- **System Response Function**: Often referred to as a fragility curve, this function defines the conditional probability of failure for various hazard levels,
  such as water surface elevations (WSEs). The system response function specifies the failure mode.
- **Consequence Function**: Sometimes called a damage function, this function describes the consequences of failure or non-failure for various hazard levels,
  such as annual maximum peak WSEs.

For example, <FigReference figKey="risk-analysis-process"/> illustrates the conceptual risk analysis process for a levee with a single failure mode and a
single system component. Beginning in the top left of the figure, the flood **hazard** is defined by an annual maximum peak flow-frequency distribution, estimated
using flood-frequency analysis methods. Next, moving to the top right, peak flow is **transformed** to a WSE using a stage-discharge rating curve estimated using
a hydraulic model. Then, moving to the bottom right, the **system response function** is defined by a probability of failure given the WSE, often derived from
engineering analysis and expert elicitation methods. And finally, moving to the bottom left, the **consequences** given failure are estimated as a function of WSE.

The risk analysis computes the expected annual consequences by integrating over these functions. For a deeper understanding of the mathematics involved in risk
analysis, refer to the technical reference manual <Citation citationKey="TechRef"/>. Additional USACE guidance on risk
analysis for flood risk management is in <Citation citationKey="EM1619"/>
and <Citation citationKey="BestPractices"/>.

This user guide demonstrates how to create a project; enter hazard, transform, response, and consequence functions; create a risk diagram, perform a risk analysis,
and review results.
