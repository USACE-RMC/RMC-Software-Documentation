# Create a Project

When you open RMC-TotalRisk, it automatically creates a Blank Project file, as shown in <FigReference figKey="blank-project" />. The blank project
is stored in your local temp directory. You may begin working with the blank project file immediately.

alt="The Blank Project file includes folders such as Hazards, Transforms, System Responses, Consequences, and Risk Analyses."
caption="RMC-TotalRisk blank project."
/>

To save changes to the blank project, click the Save button on the tool bar or under the **File** menu. This opens the **Save Project As…** prompt
(<FigReference figKey="save-project" />). Enter the desired file name and click the save button in the bottom right. Now you are ready to continue
working with RMC-TotalRisk.

caption="Save project as...."

You can also create a new project by clicking **New Project…** under the **File** menu (<FigReference figKey="new-project-file-menu" />) or by clicking
the **New Project** button on the tool bar (<FigReference figKey="new-project-toolbar" />). The first time you use RMC TotalRisk, the recent projects
list will be empty.

The project properties are shown in the **Properties** window (<FigReference figKey="project-properties" />), which is typically on the right hand
side of the main window. You may edit the project name and description.

alt="The Properties window shows the name and description of the project. This window also shows when the project was created and last modified. It also shows the project file directory, and the software version."
