reportAbstract: "RMC-BestFit is designed to enhance and expedite flood hazard assessments within the Flood Risk Management, Planning, and Dam and Levee Safety communities of practice. RMC-BestFit is a menu-driven software package, which performs distribution fitting and Bayesian estimation from a choice of thirteen probability distributions. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry capabilities, distribution fitting analysis, Bayesian estimation analysis, and report quality charts."
reportAcknowledgments: "RMC-BestFit would not exist without support of RMC leadership, in particular the RMC Lead Engineers, David Margo and John England. RMC-BestFit was developed in collaboration with Brian Skahill (ERDC-CHL), who has made significant contributions within USACE toward the advancement of Bayesian estimation methods and tools. The development team would like to also recognize Ruben Jongejan (Risk Management Consulting B.V.), who performed an external peer review of the USACE methodology for assessing hydrologic uncertainty (Jongejan, 2018). His recommendation that USACE explore a Bayesian approach for handling distribution parameter uncertainties in flood frequency analyses served as a catalyst for the development of the RMC-BestFit software. The development team is very grateful to those who helped contribute to the software."
