# Welcome to RMC-BestFit

RMC-BestFit is a menu-driven software package, which performs distribution fitting and Bayesian estimation from a choice of thirteen probability
distributions. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry capabilities,
distribution fitting analysis, Bayesian estimation analysis, and report quality charts.

## Why you should use RMC-BestFit

In Bayesian estimation, the values of the probability distribution parameters converge to a distribution rather than to a single best value.
Quantification of the parameter uncertainty is particularly important in risk analysis because it allows you to assess the value of reducing the
uncertainty. Typically, the parameter uncertainty can be reduced with more and better information through means of additional measurement, data
collection and quality control, filling gaps in missing gage data, and record extension. With Bayesian analysis, we can also specify our prior
knowledge on the parameters through expert elicitation, causal modelling, or regional analysis.

The Bayesian approach is capable of incorporating all available sources of information into an analysis. For example, in a Bayesian flood frequency
analysis, at-site gage data, paleoflood information, regional information, and causal rainfall-runoff results can be incorporated into the flood
frequency curve, which can then be used to evaluate reservoir pool stage-frequency for use in Dam Safety risk assessments.

The Bayesian estimation approach is flexible and coherent. Its assumptions are made explicit, and the analysis is repeatable and revisable. The
ability of the Bayesian approach to use all pieces of information in conjunction is a major advantage over other traditional statistical methods, such
as those that are recommended in Bulletin 17B <Citation citationKey="USGS1982" /> and Bulletin 17C <Citation citationKey="USGS2018" />.

When should you use RMC-BestFit? Any time you perform a risk analysis that involves uncertainty, you can and should use RMC-BestFit. Typical
applications in science and engineering include reliability analysis, and rainfall and flood frequency analysis.

## System Requirements

The RMC-BestFit program and all dependent libraries were developed using the .NET Framework 4.6.1. As such, the program is currently only available
for the Microsoft Windows operating system. The recommended system configuration for RMC-BestFit includes:

- 64-bit Windows Operating System (Windows 7 or newer)
- 512MB of RAM at a minimum
- 2GB of free disk space at a minimum
- Quad-Core CPU with 2.7GHz (or faster) clock speed
- 1280x1024 screen resolution or higher (and at least a 17" monitor)

## Installing RMC-BestFit

RMC-BestFit version 1.0 is available as a portable package (.zip). Installing with a portable package does not require administrative rights. Simply
extract all contents of the portable package to the desired computer location. After extraction, the package contents will look as shown
in <FigReference figKey="installing-rmcbestfit" />. Simply double-click the executable **RMC-BestFit.exe** to get started. For easy access to the
program, you can create a desktop shortcut and pin the program to your Windows taskbar.

### Setting the File Association in Windows

RMC-BestFit files have the “**.bestfit**” file extension. To have Windows automatically open**.bestfit** files with RMC-BestFit, first right-click a
**.bestfit** project file.Select **Open with…** from the resulting menu.

/>

Then, from the menu that appears when you select **Open with...**, click **Try an appon this PC** for an expanded list of already installed
applications. If you do not see RMC-BestFit, scroll to the bottom and select**Look for another app on this PC**. This will open a Windows Explorer
dialog. Navigate to and select the executable **RMC-BestFit.exe**, then click** Open. **When you’ve found RMC-BestFit and it has been selected, check
the box labeled **Always use this app to open [.bestfit] files** before you click the **OK** button. Now **.bestfit** files will appear in Windows
Explorer with the RMC-BestFit icon. You can now double-click a project file to automatically open it with RMC-BestFit.
