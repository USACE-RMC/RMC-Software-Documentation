# Graphical User Interface

RMC-BestFit is a menu-driven software package that performs distribution fitting and Bayesian estimation from a choice of thirteen probability
distributions. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry capabilities,
distribution fitting analysis, Bayesian estimation analysis, and report quality charts.

The graphical user interface consists of a **Menu Bar**, **Tool Bar**, and four window panes. Starting from the left in <FigReference figKey="rmcbestfit-user-interface" />
and moving clockwise, the panes will be referred to as the **Project Explorer**, the **Tabbed Documents**, the **Properties Window**, and the
**Message Window**. You may move, dock, hide, or close the window panesas desired.

## Menu Bar

The menu bar located at the top of main window, as shown in <FigReference figKey="rmcbestfit-menu-strip" />, contains important commands needed for
working with RMC-BestFit. For example, the **Project** menu contains commands related to the project you are working in. On the **Tools** menu, you
can customize how RMC-BestFit behaves by selecting **Options…**, or restore the project from a backup file by selecting **Restore from Backup**.

  alt="File Menu."
  caption="File Menu."
/>

If this is the first time you're using RMC-BestFit, your recent projects list will be empty. Once you have exceeded the number of projects shown in
the recent project list (the default is 10), a menu item labeled as **More Files…** will be available. After clicking this item, a **Recent Files**
dialog will open showing all available recent project files (<FigReference figKey="recent-file-dialog" />). From here, you may open any recently used
project file, or clear the recent project file list.

## Tool Bar

The **Tool Bar** is located on the main window, below the **MenuBar**. The buttons on the tool bar provide the most frequently used options under the
**File** menu:

- New Project
- Open Project
- Save Project

<Figure
  figKey="rmcbestfit-tool-bar"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure15.png"
  alt="RMC-BestFit Tool Bar."
  caption="RMC-BestFit Tool Bar."
/>

## Window Layout

In RMC-BestFit, you can customize the position, size, and behavior of windows to create window layouts that work best for you. When you customize the
layout, RMC-BestFit will remember the configuration. For example, if you change the docking location of the **Project Explorer** and then close
RMC-BestFit, the next time that you open the software, the **Project Explorer** will be docked in that same location.

### Types of Windows

RMC-BestFit has two basic window types, _tool windows_ and _document windows_. Tool windows include the **Project Explorer**, **Properties Window**,
and **Message Window**. Document windows contain the project element files, such as input data, distribution fitting analyses, and Bayesian estimation
analyses. The tool windows can be resized and dragged by their title bar, whereas the document windows can be dragged by their tab. On the tool
windows title bar, there is a drop-down with other window options. Likewise, you can right-click on the document tab to set other options on the
window. These options include docking, floating, and hiding windows.

<Figure
  figKey="tools-window-options"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure16.png"
  alt="Tools Window Options."
  caption="Tools Window Options."
/>

<Figure
  figKey="document-window-options"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure17.png"
  alt="Document Window Options."
  caption="Document Window Options."
/>

#### Tab Groups

The windows can be grouped together to enhance your ability to manage a limited workspace while you are working with two or more open documents in
RMC-BestFit. You can organize multiple document windows and tool windows into either vertical or horizontal tab groups, or move documents from one
group to another. The windows and tab groups can also be floated and moved to different monitors. When you need to view or edit two documents at once,
you can split windows by creating two horizontal tab groups as shown below in <FigReference figKey="split-document-windows" />.

<Figure
  figKey="split-document-windows"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure18.png"
  alt="Split Document Windows."
  caption="Split Document Windows."
/>

### Arrange and Dock Windows

A document window can be _docked_, so that it will belocated in the **Tabbed Documents** area, or the document can be _floated_ as a separate window
independent of the main window. You can arrange windows in the following ways:

- Dock tool windows to the edge of the main window frame.
- Float tool and document windows over or outside the main window.
- Hide tool windows along the edge of the main window.
- Display windows on different monitors.
- Reset window placement to the default layout by choosing **View** > **Reset Default Layout**.

Arrange windows by dragging or right-clicking the title bar or tab of the window to be arranged.

#### Dock Windows

When you click and drag the title bar of a tool window, or the tab of a document window, a cross shaped window placement guide will appear. During the
drag operation, when the mouse cursor is over one of the arrows in the guide, a shaded area will appear that shows you where the window will be
docked if you release the mouse button. An example of the window placement guide is shown below in <FigReference figKey="moving-and-docking" />
and <FigReference figKey="example-of-docking" />.

<Figure
  figKey="moving-and-docking"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure19.png"
  alt="Moving and Docking Document Windows."
  caption="Moving and Docking Document Windows."
/>

<FigReference figKey="example-of-docking" /> shows the **Properties Windows** being docked below the **Project Explorer**. The new location is
demarcated by the light blue shared area.

<Figure
  figKey="example-of-docking"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure20.png"
  alt="Example of Docking the Properties Window Below the Project Explorer."
  caption="Example of Docking the Properties Window Below the Project Explorer."
/>

#### Close and Auto-Hide Tool Windows

You can close a tool window by clicking on the **X** in the upper right of the title bar. To reopen the tool window, navigate to the **View** menu and
select the desired tool window to show. Tool windows have an _auto-hide_ feature, which causes a window to slide out of the way when you use a
different window. When a window is auto-hidden, the window name appears on the tab at the edge of the main window as shown
in <FigReference figKey="autohide-tool-window" />. To show the window again, move your mouse cursor over the tab so that the window slides back into
view.

<Figure
  figKey="autohide-tool-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure21.png"
  alt="Auto-Hide Tool Window."
  caption="Auto-Hide Tool Window."
/>

## Project Explorer

The **Project Explorer**, which is typically on the left-hand side of the main window, shows a graphical representation of the hierarchy of elements
within your project. After you create a new project, you can use the **Project Explorer** to view, navigate, and manage the project elements.

<Figure
  figKey="project-explorer"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure22.png"
  alt="Project Explorer."
  caption="Project Explorer."
/>

Project elements are organized under the **Input Data**, **Distribution Fitting Analysis**, and **Bayesian Estimation Analysis** folder headers. Many
menu commands are available from the right-click menu on various items in the Project Explorer. You can create new elements, or sort the element
collections, by right-clicking the header.

<Figure
  figKey="project-explorer-element"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure23.png"
  alt="Project Explorer Element Collection Header Right-Click Menu."
  caption="Project Explorer Element Collection Header Right-Click Menu."
/>

When right-clicking an individual project element, the following commands are made available: edit, copy, rename, delete, move up, and move down. When
multiple project elements are selected, only two right-click menu commands are available: edit and delete. Double-clicking a project element will
open it for editing.

<Figure
  figKey="project-explorer-element"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure24.png"
  alt="Project Explorer Element Right-Click Menu."
  caption="Project Explorer Element Right-Click Menu."
/>

You can move individual project elements within a collection by left-clicking and dragging the element. A mouse cursor adornment will appear
indicating where the element will be moved, as shown in <FigReference figKey="project-explorer-element" />. You can also drag and drop Input Data from
one RMC-BestFit project to another.

<Figure
  figKey="project-explorer-element"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure25.png"
  alt="Project Explorer Element Drag and Drop."
  caption="Project Explorer Element Drag and Drop."
/>

## Tabbed Documents

In RMC-BestFit, _document windows_ contain the project element files, such as input data, distribution fitting analyses, and Bayesian estimation
analyses. When you open a project element for editing, it will automatically open into the tabbed document group, which is typically located in the
center of the main window (see <FigReference figKey="tabbed-document-group" />). You can reorder the tabbed documents, drag, or float them outside of
the main window. When you click on, or activate, a document window, the associated project element properties will be shown in the **Properties
Window**.

<Figure
  figKey="tabbed-document-group"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure26.png"
  alt="Tabbed Document Group."
  caption="Tabbed Document Group."
/>

## Properties Window

The **Properties Window**, which is typically on the right-hand side of the main window, displays the properties for the project and project elements.
To access the element properties, first open the element for edit, then click on, or activate, the associated tabbed document. Some properties are
common among all project elements, such as **Name** and **Description**, while others are unique to the specific elements. Properties are organized
into groups for easier navigation. When you click on a property, the property description will be placed at the bottom of the properties window as
shown in <FigReference figKey="properties-window" />. All analyses will be run from the properties window.

<Figure
  figKey="properties-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure27.png"
  alt="Properties Window."
  caption="Properties Window."
/>

## Message Window

The **Message Window** shows you errors, warnings, messages and event logs regarding the current state of your project. If there are any errors in
your project file, they are listed here. The **Message Window** lets you perform the following tasks:

- Display the errors, warnings, messages, and events produced while you work in RMC-BestFit.
- Double-click any error message entry to open the project element where the problem occurs.
- Filter the type of entries that are displayed in the Message Window. The default is to only display errors and warnings.
- Export all entries to a text file.

Once you resolve an error, warning, or message, the entry will be removed from the Message Window. You may customize the font color of the various
message types by navigating to **Tools** > **Options**. See the Personalize RMC-BestFit section for more details.

<Figure
  figKey="message-window"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure28.png"
  alt="Message Window."
  caption="Message Window."
/>

## Personalize RMC-BestFit

You can personalize RMC-BestFit in various ways to enhance the user experience by navigating to **Tools** > **Options**. The **Options** dialog allows
the user to customize the Application, File Management, Message Window, and Default settings.

### Application Options

You can set the application color theme to be the Light theme or Blue theme as shown in <FigReference figKey="options-dialog-light" />
and <FigReference figKey="options-dialog-blue" />. The default is set to the Light theme. You can choose whether or not to **Save the window docking
layout on close** so that RMC-BestFit will remember it when you reopen the application. You can also set the number of window items shown in the
**Window** menu and the number of recent project items shown in the Recent Project list under the **File** menu.

  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure30.png"
  alt="Options Dialog with Blue Color Theme."
  caption="Options Dialog with Blue Color Theme."
/>

### File Management Options

RMC-BestFit project files are saved as SQLite databases. SQLite is a self-contained, high-reliability, SQL database engine, which is also the most
used database engine in the world (https://www.sqlite.org/). Database files can grow quickly as you use them, sometimes hindering performance. They
can also occasionally become corrupt or damaged. You can use the **Tools** > **Compact & Optimize Project File** command to prevent or fix these
problems. You can also set RMC-BestFit to **Compact & optimize project file on close**.

You can set the time interval in which a project backup file is created. A file with the extension .bak is automatically created when a project is
opened. If the project closes successfully, then the .bak file is deleted.The database file can be damaged or corrupted, or the system could close
unexpectedly causing you to lose important data, so on occasion, you might need to restore the project from a backup file by selecting **Tools** >
**Restore from Backup**.

  figKey="file-management-options"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-bestfit/users-guide/v1.0/figure31.png"
  alt="File Management Options."
  caption="File Management Options."
/>

### Message Window Options

You can adjust the auditory and visual setting for the **Message Window**. You can choose to turn on or off the beep sound effect and select the font
color for the different message types, as shown below in <FigReference figKey="message-window-options" />.

## Plot Features

RMC-BestFit has plot features which allow you to examine the plot data and customize the plots for reporting purposes. There is a tool bar located to
the right of each plot, which allows you to interact with the plot in the following ways:

- Track data to get the X-Y point values.
- Pan the plot up and down or side to side.
- Zoom in to the plot data.
- Zoom out to the plot extents.
- Add annotations to the plot.
- Save the plot image as a PNG, PDF, or SVG file.
- Export plot series data to aComma Separate (.csv), Excel (.xlsx), or SQLite (.sqlite) file.
- Change the plot properties to create a customized appearance. The changes to the plot properties are saved and persist when you open and close the
  project and project element.

  caption="Zoom In on Plot."
/>

### Add Annotation

Annotations are elements of the plot that show information that is not part of a plot series. Annotations are not included in the legend and not used
by the tracker. You may add the following annotation types to the plot:

- Arrow
- Text
- Vertical Line
- Horizontal Line
- Rectangle
- Ellipse
- Point
- Polygon
- Polyline

The annotations can be moved by clicking and dragging them to a new spot. An example of adding an arrow annotation is shown
in <FigReference figKey="plot-annotations" /> and <FigReference figKey="example-of-arrow" />.
