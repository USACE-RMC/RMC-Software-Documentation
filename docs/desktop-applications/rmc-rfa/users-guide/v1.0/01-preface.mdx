# Preface

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Risk Management Center (RMC) developed the Reservoir Frequency Analysis
software (RMC-RFA) to facilitate hydrologic hazard assessments within the USACE Dam Safety Program. RMC-RFA has
been peer review, computationally verified, and validated in accordance with Enterprise Standard (ES) - 08101 <i>Software
Validation for the Hydrology, Hydraulics and Coastal Community of Practice (HH&C CoP)</i>.

RMC-RFA is designed for interactive use in a multi-tasking environment. The software features a fully integrated modeling
platform, including a graphical user interface, data entry capabilities, statistical analysis components, reservoir routing
models, stochastic simulation, and results reporting tools. To request a free copy of the software, provide future suggestions,
report errors, or request additional information, please contact the developer at:
