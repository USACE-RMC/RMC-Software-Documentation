## RMC-RFA versions

### Software Versioning

RMC-RFA uses a semantic versioning system in the format of "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH":

1. MAJOR version for significant software changes that are not compatible with previous versions.
2. MINOR version for additional features that are included in a backwards-compatible manner.
3. PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version will not be modified. Any modifications to the
software will be released as a new version.

### Software History

The computational engine of RMC-RFA draws on methods included in existing stochastic simulation software, including the
Monte Carlo Reservoir Analysis Model (MCRAM), the Flood Risk Analysis (FRA) module in HEC-WAT, and the Stochastic
Event Flood Model (SEFM).

### RMC-RFA Versions

#### Version 1.0.0

The initial program release is called RMC-RFA Version 1.0.0 and its intended to replace MCRAM as the preferred scerening level tool 
for estimating frequency relationships for dams in the USACE Dam Safety Program. MCRAM is a Microsoft Excel based application, which
uses Excel as a user interface for model inputs and displaying of outputs for MCRAM. In MCRAM, all computations are performed in code 
via Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and model output is stored in a Microsoft Access database. RMC-RFA has several notable
improvements to MCRAM, including the following:

- RMC-RFA is written in Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), which is a multi-paradigm, objectoriented
programming language, implemented on the .NET Framework.

- The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed with the Windows Forms (WinForms)
graphical class library included in the .NET Framework.

- Data storage for the software relies on SQLite, which is a popular relational database
management system that does not have a 2 GB file size limitation like Microsoft Access,
allowing for much larger stochastic simulations.

- The stochastic simulation employs a stratified sampling approach, rather than the naive
Monte Carlo sampling procedures utilized in MCRAM, significantly improving simulation
efficiency.

- Supporting statistical analyses, such as flood seasonality, stage duration, and empirical
frequency analysis, are included as internal components in RMC-RFA and do not require
additional software.

- Inflow volume-frequency relationships can be defined using the Log Normal, Log Gumbel,
Log Pearson Type III, or Log Generalized Extreme Value distribution, allowing the user to
also assess the range of uncertainty and sensitivity in reservoir stage-frequency due to
statistical model selection.

- The software allows for an unlimited number of input data sets, analyses, reservoir
models, and simulation configurations.

- There is a suite of charting and tabulating features for viewing and analyzing simulation
results.

- Simulation run times have been significantly reduced from those of MCRAM.
