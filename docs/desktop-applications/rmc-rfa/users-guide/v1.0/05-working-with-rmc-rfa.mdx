# Working with RMC-RFA 

The following data should be gathered before creating an RMC-RFA project: 
- Water control manual. 
- Period of record inflow, outflow, and stage data. 
- Inflow hydrograph shape, data, preferably sub-daily. 
- Reservoir routing information, such as stage-storage-discharge relationships.

The following analyses should be performed external to RMC-RFA prior to creating an RMC-RFA project: 
- Critical inflow duration analysis 
- Volume-duration-frequency analysis

This user's manual includes limited details on the data requirements or how to perform the above analyses. For greater detail, please consult the USACE hydrologic hazard assessment
methodology document <i> An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves for Dams</i>, Bulletin 17C <i>Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency</i>, and
Engineering Manual (EM) 1110-2-1415 <i>Hydrologic Frequency Analysis</i>.

## Launching RMC-RFA 

To start RMC-RFA navigate to Documents, open the RMC-RFA folder and select the RMC-RFA executable. If you have a shortcut created, or have pinned the program to the start menu
or task bar, the program can be opened by clicking on the RMC-RFA icon.

  alt="Location of New Project button in the tool bar."
  caption="Location of New Project button in the tool bar."
/>

The user is required to enter a name, select a unit system, and determine a project location. Adding a description of the study is optional,
but can be beneficial. Once you have entered all the information, click Create. After clicking Create, the project name will be listed in the project explorer, and the user is ready to input data.
Projects will be saved with the extension .rfa.sqlite. In a file folder they will have the project name followed by the extension.

**Note**: All names must be limited to 50 characters and cannot include any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].

## Open an Existing Project 

An existing project can be opened from the menu bar, by clicking *File→Open Project* or by selecting the project from a list of recent projects under *File→Recent Projects*.

## Input Data 

There are four types of input data required for a RMC-RFA project.

- Discharge Gage
- Inflow Hydrograph 
- Stage Gage
- Volume frequency Curve 

**NOTE**: Raw data investigation is the most important step in any dam safety analysis. Many data sets have numerous occurrences of missing data, faulty data, or other issues that can
impact analysis. The quality of the data that is analyzed will make the largest impact on the quality of results obtained from any computer program. In addition, know what data records are
available, and how / when any operational changes have been executed. If analysis relies on a period of record, the entire dataset used needs to be homogeneous and not from mixed
records or periods.

### Interpolate Missing Data 

Interpolate missing data is an option on the tables for discharge gage, inflow hydrograph, and stage gage. This function interpolates missing data from one defined ordinate to another
along a straight line. If a second cell/ordinate is not defined, the interpolate function will fill data in to the end of the table, along a straight line interval.

  caption="Input data with interpolated missing data. Note the new data is in red, as the data has not been saved yet."
/>

### Discharge Gage

The first set of data required to perform a simulation is a record of the inflows at the dam. The entire Period of Record (POR) should be used when available and appropriate. This data
should be a continuous record. Note that when you create a new discharge gage, the time step option is set to 1-day and cannot be changed. This is because the discharge gage and
stage gage require a mandatory 1-day time step. Daily averaged data for the POR is preferred. If the data is not in 1-day time step, it can easily be calculated from a 15-min time step or
hourly time step using the math function in HEC-DSSVue. Discharge gage data is used for computing Flood Seasonality and Empirical Frequency Curves.

1. **Name and Description** 
- You must enter a name, all names are limited to 50 characters and cannot include the any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].
- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Time Window**
- Select a start date and an end date for the inflow data you have available.
- Hit *Resize Table*

3. **Input Data Table**
- After hitting resize table the Input Data Table will populate with ordinates, data, and time.
- Manually enter or copy in the flows for the entire data set.

4. **Plot**
- When data has been entered the plot will generate. The plot has all the same features described in *Chart Features*.

  alt="Discharge gage input window filled out for Sayers Dam."
  caption="Discharge gage input window filled out for Sayers Dam."
/>


### Inflow Hydrograph 

Inflow hydrographs for major historical events, large events, or synthetic events should be entered. The shape of the hydrograph is a reflection of the response of the watershed to an
event. At least one inflow hydrograph shape is required to perform a simulation. Multiple inflow hydrographs can be sampled as part of the simulation. The inflow hydrograph shape is
scaled up or down based on the sampled inflow volume in the stochastic simulation.

- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Time Window**
- Select a start date and an end date for the inflow hydrograph.
- Select a timestep from the drop down menu. Four time steps are available in this input data window; 15 min, 1 hour, 6 hour, and daily.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-60"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure60.png"
  alt="Time step options for inflow hydrographs."
  caption="Time step options for inflow hydrographs."
/>

- Hit *Resize Table* 

3. **Input Data Table** 
- After hitting resize table the Input Data Table will populate with ordinates, date, and time.
- Manually enter or copy in the flows for the entire hydrograph.

4. **Plot**
- When data has been entered the plot will generate. The plot has all the same features described in *Chart Features*.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-62"

  alt="Inflow hydrograph filled out for Sayer's Dam."
  caption="Inflow hydrograph filled out for Sayer's Dam."
/>

**Note on selecting an inflow hydrograph**: An observed inflow hydrograph from a major event should be used if at all possible. However, if no such events are available, a
synthetic event, such as the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) hydrograph may be utilized. For this type of analysis, the inflow hydrograph should be unregulated.

**Note on time step**: Verify that your inflow hydrograph shapes are inputted in one of the options for time steps. If your inflow data is in a different increment it can easily be converted
to a longer duration increment using the math function “change time interval” under the tools menu in HEC-DSSVue.

### Stage Gage

For stages, the entire Period of Record (POR) for the current operation procedures should be used when available and appropriate. This data should be a continuous record. Note that
when you create a new stage gage, the time step option is set to 1-day and cannot be changed. This is because the discharge gage and stage gage require a mandatory 1-day time step.
Daily averaged data for the POR is preferred. If the data is not in 1-day time step, it can easily be calculated from a 15-min time step or hourly time step using the math function in HECDSSVue.
Stage gage data is used to compute *Reservoir Starting Stage Duration* curves and *Empirical Frequency Curves*.

3. **Input Data Table**
- After hitting *Resize Table* the Input Data Table will populate with ordinates, date, and time.
- Manually enter or copy in the stages for the entire data set.

4. **Plot**
- When data has been entered the plot will generate. The plot has all the same features described in *Chart Features*.

### Volume Frequency Curve

Prior to creating a new volume frequency curve, the following analyses should be performed external to RMC-RFA:
- Critical inflow duration analysis
- Volume-duration-frequency analysis

For greater detail, please consult the USACE hydrologic hazard assessment methodology document *An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves for Dams*,
Bulletin 17C *Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency, and Engineering Manual* (EM) 1110-2-1415 *Hydrologic Frequency Analysis*.

  alt="Volume Frequency Curve Window."
  caption="Volume Frequency Curve Window."
/>

1. **Name & Description**
- You must enter a name, all names are limited to 50 characters and cannot include the any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].
- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Parameters**
- Select a Probability Distribution.
- Enter distribution parameters as mean of log, standard deviation of log, and skew of log.
-  Enter the equivalent years of record.
    - The equivalent years of record impacts the estimated uncertainty bounds. The longer the years of record, the smaller the knowledge uncertainty in the form of sampling error.
      See the Basic Framework section for more detail.
- Enter the duration in days
    -The duration should correspond to the critical inflow duration, which is defined as the inflow duration that results in the highest water surface elevations for the reservoir of
interest.
-After the parameters are entered, click the *compute* button. 

3. **Tabular Results**
- After computing the Tabular Results will be populated. RMC-RFA only provides 90% uncertainty bounds as default.

4.**Plot**
- After computing, the Plot will be generated. RMC-RFA only provides 90%uncertainty bounds as default.

  alt="Volume Frequency curve after computing for Sayer's Dam."
  caption="Volume Frequency curve after computing for Sayer's Dam."
/>

#### Parameters 

The following parameters need to be determined before computing volume frequency curve:
- Probability Distribution
-  Mean (of log)
- Standard Deviation (of log)
- Skew (of log)
- Equivalent Years of Record
- Duration

  alt="Parameters for volume frequency curve."
  caption="Volume Frequency curve after computing for Sayer's Dam."
/>

##### Probability Distributions

In RMC-RFA, inflow volume-frequency relationships can be defined using the Log Normal, Log Gumbel, Log Pearson Type III, or Log Generalized Extreme Value distribution, allowing the
user to also assess the range of uncertainty in reservoir stage-frequency due to statistical model selection. The Log Pearson Type III distribution is the default distribution in RMC-RFA. In
the current version of RMC-RFA all probability distributions require input parameters in log space.

  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure69.png"
  alt="Parameters for volume frequency curve."
  caption="Probability distributions for volume frequency curve."
/>

**Note on Selecting a Probability Distribution**:

In general, follow the guidance outlined in the USACE hydrologic hazard assessment methodology document An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves
for Dams, Bulletin 17C Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency, and Engineering Manual (EM) 1110-2-1415 Hydrologic Frequency Analysis. USACE recommends using the Log
Pearson Type III for flow frequency. However, there are cases where a user will want to evaluate the sensitivity associated with selecting a different model. General guidance for
distribution selection is provided below and summarized from Predictive Hydrology: A Frequency Analysis Approach by Meylan et al.

- <u>Log Normal</u>: Many probability distributions can be transformed by replacing the variate with its logarithmic value. The annual maximum flow series are typically not represented well by
the Normal distribution. The data is skewed to right because flows are only positive in magnitude (whereas a Normal distribution will include negative flows). When the data is leftbounded
(cannot be less than zero) and positively skewed, a logarithmic transformation of the data may allow the use of the Log Normal distribution. It can be argued that the
occurrence of a flood results from the combination of a large number of multiplying factors (Chow, 1954). Therefore, the central limit theorem leads to the conclusion that annual
maximum flows follow a Log Normal distribution because the product of n variables yields to the sum of n logarithms.

- <u>Log Gumbel</u>: This is a two-parameter distribution in the generalized extreme value family (EV Type 1). The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the GEV where γ = 0 (See
section on GEV below). Peak and short duration flood events It is widely used due to its ease of use.

- <u>Log Pearson Type III (LPIII)</u>: This distribution is also called the three-parameter Gamma distribution. Since 1967, the US water Resource Council has recommended and required the
use of LPIII distributions for all US flow frequency analysis for flood insurance purposes. This distribution is flexible and usually applied to volumes corresponding to annual maximum
floods. However, it should be noted that the volumes are not maximum values in the statistical sense since peak floods that are lower but of longer duration can still produce larger
volumes.

- <u>Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)</u>: This is a flexible three-parameter distribution in the Extreme Value family that combines the Gumbel, Frechet and Weibull distribution. From the
standpoint of the asymptotic theory, the GEV represents the distribution of the maximum of n random variables, and is often considered the most appropriate for modeling flow
frequency.

##### Equivalent Years of Record 

The equivalent years of record impacts the estimated uncertainty bounds.The longer in tthe years of record, the smaller the knowledge uncertainty in the form of sampling error.

##### Duration

The duration should correspond to the cricial inflow duration, which is defined as the inflow duration that results in the highest water surface elevations for the reservoir of interest.

#### Tabular Results

Right click on the Tabular Results and a context menu will appear as shown in the figure below. The user can select all, copy, and copy with table headers. However, the user cannot
paste into or edit the table data.

## Analyses

There are three analyses that should be performed for a RMC-RFA project:
- Flood Seasonality
- Reservoir Starting Stage Duration
- Empirical Frequency Curve

### Flood Seasonality 

The term *flood seasonality* is intended to describe the frequency of occurrence of rare floods on a seasonal basis, where a rare flood is defined as any event where the flow exceeds some
user specified threshold for a specified flow duration. This approach is commonly referred to as the “Peak-Over-Threshold” method.

Flood seasonality information is required in many applications in hydrology and water resources, such as seasonal streamflow forecasting, flood protection, and water resources
infrastructure operations. For the purposes of the hydrologic hazard assessment of dams, flood seasonality information tells us which season an extreme flood event is most likely to
occur. The information can also provide insight on mixed populations in meteorology. For example, a reservoir in the west will likely have a snowmelt season and a rainy season. Flood
seasonality information can also be important if the reservoir is operated with seasonal guide curves. In many flood control reservoirs, the pool is lowered ahead of the rainy season in
order to provide more storage ahead of any large flood events.

1. **Name & Description** 
- You must enter a name, all names are limited to 50 characters and cannot include the any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].
- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Parameters**
- Select a discharge gage to use in the analysis.
- Enter the threshold flow, critical duration, maximum events per year, and the minimum days between events. See the Parameters section for details.
- After the parameters are entered, click the compute button.

3. **Tabular Results**
- After computing, the Tabular Results will be populated.

4. **Plot**
- After computing, the Plot will be generated.

  alt="Flood seasonality after computing for Sayer's Dam."
  caption="Flood seasonality after computing for Sayer's Dam."
/>

#### Parameters 

The following parameters need to be determined before computing flood seasonality:
- Discharge Gage
- Threshold Flow
- Critical Duration
- Maximum Events Per Year
- Minimum Days Between Events

<Figure
  figKey="figure-74"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure74.png"
  alt="Parameters for flood seasonality."
  caption="Parameters for flood seasonality."
/>

##### Threshold Flow 

The threshold flow is usually chosen as a flow that corresponds to a specified frequency level (i.e. 2-year, 5-year or 10-year return period) for a specified critical duration to provide a
common measure or rareness of the flood. There are two conflicting goals in selecting a threshold for identifying rare floods:

1. The threshold needs to be high enough so that large events are considered in the analysis.
2. There needs to be a dataset large enough to reduce uncertainties arising from sampling error.

Considering the two goals, the threshold needs to be set to as rare a frequency level as possible that will still provide a sufficiently large sample size. Sample sizes of 30-40 flood events
are usually adequate.

Determining an appropriate threshold flow to meet this criteria is an iterative process that requires a VDF curve for the critical duration, as described in the Volume Frequency Curve
section.

##### Critical Duration 

Enter the critical duration in days. This should be the same critical duration chosen the Volume Frequency Curve. The critical duration should remain the same for the simulation.

##### Max Events Per Year

RMC-RFA will filter the period of record based on the threshold flow and critical duration. However, the resulting sample set may not be large enough to reduce uncertainties arising from
sampling error. Therefore, in order to meet the second criterion above, a partial-duration series technique can be employed. A partial-duration series represents the occurrence of all
independent events of interest, regardless of whether two or more occurred in the same year. Caution must be exercised in selecting the maximum number of events per year and the
days between events to ensure the events are hydrologically independent.

##### Min Days Between Events

This parameter is used in conjunction with the “Maximum events per year” option. The minimum number of days between events is used to identify independent flood events. For
example, if the critical inflow duration is two days, then a minimum of 7 days between events should be sufficient to ensure independence. The minimum number of days between events
can also be determined by visual inspection of the flow time series to see the typical time between large flow events.

#### Tabular Results

The Tabular Results are presented on two tabs:
1. Seasonal Frequency
2. Flood Events

### Reservoir Starting Stage Duration

Stage duration curves represent the percent of time during which specified reservoir stages are exceeded at a given location. Ordinarily, daily variations in 
stages are inconsequential, so duration curves are typically developed using daily average stages. *Reservoir starting stage duration* curves represent the percent of time
during which antecedent reservoir stages are exceeded. Starting stage duration curves are developed by first filtering observed daily average stage data so that the record 
only contains typical starting stages based on a pool change threshold. Then, the filtered record is sorted by month or season. The filtering of the stage data is performed
to avoid a certain degree of "double counting" of flood events.

In RMC-RFA, reservoir starting stage duration curves are used to derive reservoir stage-frequency curves by combining the annual exceedance probability of the inflow flood event
with the probability of the stage prior to the flood event.

#### Parameters

The following parameters need to be determined before computing reservoir starting stage duration:
- Stage Gage
- Pool Change Threshold
- Typical High Pool Duration

  alt="Parameters for reservoir starting stage duration."

##### Pool Change Threshold

The pool change threshold represents the maximum rate of rise of the pool per day. It will allow the starting pool elevation to be populated from daily elevations that are theorized to occur
prior to any given flood event by essentially deleting all stage hydrographs that rise or fall faster than the entered threshold. If a large threshold value is chosen, you may artificially drive
your starting pool too high as it takes in to account flood events where stages tend to rise quickly. An appropriate pool change threshold can by determined by visual inspection of a stage
hydrograph from a normal rainfall year; i.e., a year where the reservoir was operated normally because there was no significant flood events.

First, inspect the period of record. Choose a year without a significant event and inspect the stage hydrograph from that year. You can then estimate the rate of pool change per day from
the hydrograph. It may be beneficial to review several normal years and take an average daily rate of rise. The normal rate of rise can be compared to a hydrograph from an event year
where the stage should be rising much faster.

For example, the Joseph Foster Sayers Dam stage hydrograph below is taken from the spring of 1999, a normal precipitation year. The rate of rise per day is shown in below. The
maximum rate of rise is about 2 feet. After repeating this process for the years 2000 and 2001, also years with normal rainfall, it is determined that approximately 2 feet is indeed a good
estimation for maximum normal rate of rise for this project.

As you can see in the figure below, the hydrograph taken from the September 2004 shows a much faster rate of rise, consistent with a flood event. Sensitivity 
runs should be made to determine the appropriate threshold that meets the above criteria.

*Note*: Setting the pool change threshold to zero will result in no filtered stage gage date: i.e., stage duration curves will be constructed from the full period of record.

##### Typical High Pool Duration

Similar to the Pool Change Threshold, the high pool duration is another parameter used to filter out large events for the purpose of distilling the record to only the typical starting pool
elevations. It too can be determined by visual inspection. In this case, chose an event stage hydrograph and visually inspect how many days the high pool typically lasts. Again, it may be
beneficial to analyze several event hydrographs, if they are available, and take an average of the high pool durations.

#### Tabular Results

The Tabular Results are provided in two sections:
1. Stage Data Table
2. Tabular Results

##### Stage Data Table

The raw stage gage data along with the filtered *starting stage* data are reported in the Stage Data Table as shown below.

#### Plot

There are two plots provided in a reservoir stage duration analysis (both plots have all of the same features discussed in Chart Features):
1. Stage Gage 
2. Duration Curves

The Stage Gage plot illustrates the effect of the selected filtering Parameters as shown below.

### Empirical Frequency Curve

For the evaluation of hydrologic hazards, an extreme-value series of annual maximum discharges or stages can be generated from the observed period of record. An empirical frequency
is constructed by the ranking annual maximum data in descending order, assigning the data a plotting position, and then plotting the data on a probability plot.

- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Parameters**

- Enter the duration, and select a plotting position and year specification. See the Parameters section for details.
- After the parameters are entered, click the compute button.

3. **Tabular Results**

  caption="Empirical frequency curve after computing for Sayer's Dam."

#### Parameters

The following parameters need to be determined before computing empirical frequency curve:
- Gage Type (either Discharge or Stage)
- Gage
- Duration
- Plotting Position formula
- Year Specification

<Figure
  figKey="figure-96"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure96.png"
  alt="Parameters for empirical frequency curve."
  caption="Parameters for empirical frequency curve."
/>

##### Duration

Annual maximum values will extracted for the specified duration. If a discharge gage representing inflow to the reservoir is selected, then the duration could be the critical inflow duration,
which is defined as the inflow duration that results in the highest water surface elevations for the reservoir of interest. Whereas, if the discharge gage represents outflow, the specified
duration could be the duration likely to cause spillway erosion. If a stage gage is selected, the duration should be set to 1 in order to capture peak stages for comparison in a Simulation.

##### Plotting Position Formulas

There are a number of plotting position formulas for the estimation of empirical frequency. The formulas compute the exceedance probability of a data point based on the rank of the data
point in a sample of a given size. Among different formulas, the differences in estimated exceedance frequency for each data point is minor for ranks of 3 and lower (the third largest value
and all smaller values.) For the largest observation in the set (rank 1) the difference can be quite large.

In RMC-RFA, there are three plotting positions available for selection in the empirical frequency curve analysis:
1. Weibull (A and B = 0), which is the default
2. Median (A and N = 0.3) 
3. Hazen (A and B = 0.5)

The HEC-SSP user's manual provides a great summary of plotting positions as shown below:

  alt="Example from HEC-SSP User's Manual."
  caption="Example from HEC-SSP User's Manual."
/>

##### Year Specification

This option allows the user to define the beginning and ending date for the analysis year for ranking data. These dates are used for extracting annual maximum discharges or stages. It is
important to choose a year specification that captures all flood events from a specific hydrologic regime. For example, if the flood season typically occurs in the spring and summer, then a
calendar year (starts Jan 1) specification would sufficiently capture those events. However, if the flood season occurs in the fall and winter, then a water year (starts Oct 1) specification
would better capture those events.

In RMC-RFA, there are two year specifications available for selection in the empirical frequency curve analysis:
1. Water Year (starts Oct 1), which is the default
2. Calendar Year (starts Jan 1)

## Reservoir Models

A reservoir routing model is used to determine pool stages and discharges by routing a flood hydrograph through the reservoir pool and outlets. The reservoir routing model includes
characteristics of the reservoir, such as the stage-storage relationship, and information about physical structures, like spillways and other outlets. These regulating outlets are commonly
simplified within a stage-storage-discharge relationship.

RMC-RFA allows a user to create more than one reservoir model, if desired, allowing the user to look at routing results using different operational scenarios. For example, the user could
create one stage-storage-discharge function associated with spillway operations only, and a second corresponding to spillway operations and gate operations. This would allow
comparison of simulation with and without gates operable.

### Stage-Storage-Discharge Function

#### Modified Puls Routing

Reservoir routing in RMC-RFA is based on a "hydrologic method", which is concentrated on the concept of storage for the flood water and does not directly include 
effects of resistance to the flow. The routing of a flood by using a hydrologic method in a given reservoir is based on the continuity equation which equates the rate 
of change of the storage, <EquationNoRef equation = "\frac{dS}{dt}" /> in the reservoir to the difference between the inflow, <em>I</em>, and outflow, <em>O</em>:

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-1"
  equation="\frac{dS}{dt} = I - O" 
/>

Specifically, RMC-RFA uses a finite difference approximation of the continuity equation called the Modified Puls routing method, also known as storage routing or level-pool routing.
Using a simple backward differencing scheme and rearranging the continuity equation to isolate the unknown values gives:

<Equation
 equationKey="equation-2"
 equation="\left(\frac{S_{t}}{dt} + \frac{O_{t}}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{I_{t-1} + I_{t}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{S_{t-1}}{dt} - \frac{O_{t-1}}{2}\right)" 
/>

Where <EquationNoRef equation = "I_{t-1}"/> and <em>I</em> = inflow hydrograph ordinates at times <EquationNoRef equation = "t-1"/> and <EquationNoRef equation = "t"/>, respectively; 
<EquationNoRef equation = "O_{t-1}"/> and <em>O</em> = outflow hydrograph ordinates at times <EquationNoRef equation = "t-1"/> and <EquationNoRef equation = "t"/>, respectively; 
<EquationNoRef equation = "S_{t-1}"/> and <em>S</em> = storage in the reservoir at times <EquationNoRef equation = "t-1"/> and <EquationNoRef equation = "t"/>, respectively;

The Modified Puls method has some limitations, which includes among others rivers with significant backwater effects, tributary inflows, and flat to mild channel slopes. If the dam being
assessed has a long and narrow reservoir or has a potential for significant backwater effects, the the Modified Puls routing method included in RMC-RFA may not provide accurate results
for peak stage.

#### Stage versus Storage Volume

A stage versus storage relationship (also referred to as a stage-storage function) relates water surface elevation to the volume of water stored. It provides a geometric description of the
reservoir that is used during routing to determine the rise or fall of the water surface elevation given a change in the volume of stored water. In most cases, a stage-storage curve will be
provided in the project water control manual or can be attained from the dam owner, such as the Corps District. In some cases, the water control manual will only provide a stage-area
relationship, which can also be used to develop a stage-storage relationship.

#### Stage versus Discharge

A stage versus discharge relationship (also referred to as a stage-discharge function) relates water surface elevation to the required discharge associated with the outlet works, spillway or
overtopping. Stage-discharge information will be provided in the project water control manual. The stage-discharge relationship should encompass any releases from the dam, including
outlet works, spillways, and overtopping if necessary. Overtopping discharges should be included in the stage-discharge relationship in order to properly capture extreme flood events
that result in overtopping. For additional details on stage versus storage and stage versus discharge, refer to "*An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves
for Dams*"

  alt="Simulation parameters main window."
  caption="Simulation parameters main window."
/>

1. **Input Parameters**

- Select which inflow hydrographs to include in the simulation and assign them a weight.

2. **Simulation Settings**
- Select the Simulations Settings tab.
- Select a Simulation type.
- Enter the Routing Options: the routing time window in days and the routing time step.
- Select Sampling Options: the Number of Realizations, Skip Inflow Events With AEP, and PRNG Seed. 

<Figure
  figKey="figure-115"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure115.png"
  alt="Simulation settings tab."
  caption="Simulation settings tab."
/>

3. **Output Options**
- Select the Output Options tab.
- Determine which Frequency Curves you would like the simulation to create.
- Set an Uncertainty Bound.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-116"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure116.png"
  alt="Output options tab."
  caption="Output options tab."
/>

#### Input Parameters

Input Parameters is where the user selects the parameters to be used in a simulation.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-117"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure117.png"
  alt="Input parameters tab."
  caption="Input parameters tab."
/>

The Statistical Parameters are the Volume Frequency Curve, Flood Seasonality Analysis, and the Starting Stage Duration Analysis. The drop down menu associated with each of these
items will show the names of the analyses performed under the analyses tab. Reservoir Model allows the user to select one of the reservoir models they have created. Selecting a
reservoir model will populate the plot with the dam features. Finally the user choses which Inflow Hydrograph to use for the simulation, and assigns the inflow hydrograph a weight to
influence how often it is used in the simulation. You can perform a simulation with as little as one inflow hydrograph.

The weight assigned to each inflow hydrograph determines how often that particular hydrograph will be sampled in the simulation. The weighting needs to be numeric. The weights do not
need to sum to 1. Instead, the weights are normalized at the start of the simulation. For example if you have two hydrographs, and assign one a weight of 1 and the second a weight of 2,
then the first hydrograph will be sampled 1/3 of the time, and the second hydrograph will be sampled 2/3 of the time.

**Note**: RMC-RFA will scale the input hydrograph shape to match the sampled inflow volume based on the selected critical duration defined in the Volume Frequency Curve input.

#### Simulation Settings

Simulation settings determine the simulation type, routing options, and sampling options and has a large influence on how long the simulation will take to perform.
- Simulation Type 
- Routing Options
- Sampling Options

<Figure
  figKey="figure-118"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure118.png"
  alt="Simulation settings tab."
  caption="Simulation settings tab."
/>

##### Simulation Type

Three options are available for simulation type:
- Simulate Full Uncertainty
- Simulate Expected Frequency Curve Only
- Simulate Median Frequency Curve Only

For rapid sesnsitivity analysis, the user should select either *Simulate Expected Frequency Curve Only* or *Simulate Median Frequency Curve Only* as run times are much shorter.
*Simulate Full Uncertainty* will have teh longest run time, as it calculates the Median Curve, Expected Curve, and Uncertainty Bounds.

##### Routing Options

*Routing Time Window (DAYS)*: This indicates the number of days to route the simulation. This value should be at least as long as the critical inflow duration defined by the Volume
Frequency Curve input. The routing time window needs to be long enough to ensure the reservoir stage has had enough time to crest.

*Routing Time Step*: A drop down menu, allowing the user to choose from the following simulation time steps: 15-min, 1-Hr, 6-Hr, and 1-Day. The routing time step chosen will affect the
simulation run time (e.g., a simulation with a 15-Min time step will take about four times longer than a simulation with a 1-Hr time step).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-119"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure119.png"
  alt="Routing options tab."
  caption="Routing options tab."
/>

##### Sampling Options

- Number of Realizations
- Skip Inflow Events 
- PRNG Seed

<Figure
  figKey="figure-120"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure120.png"
  alt="Sampling options tab."
  caption="Sampling options tab."
/>

###### Number of Realizations

This is a drop down menu, allowing the user to choose the number of realizations to perform in the simulation. The number of realization options can be seen in the figure below.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-121"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure121.png"
  alt="Number of realizations options."
  caption="Number of realizations options."
/>

The number of realizations should be chosen with consideration of run time, accuracy, and project needs. Often, a user will run the simulation with a smaller number of realizations at first
in order to ensure that the simulation configuration is running stable and producing reasonable results. It is recommended that final simulations use 1,000 realizations or more. This will
produce accurate uncertainty bounds while also having manageable run times.

###### Skip Inflow Events With AEP

The skip inflow option allows the user to skip inflow events with an annual exceedance probability greater than the value selected in the drop down menu, which is shown in the figure below: 

<Figure
  figKey="figure-122"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure122.png"
  alt="Skip inflow events with options."
  caption="Skip inflow events with options."
/>

The skip inflow option, similar to number of realizations, should be chosen with consideration of simulation run time, accuracy, and project needs. If reservoir frequency relationships are
only needed for extreme events, then it is recommended that a skip option of 0.10 is used. This will reduce run times while still producing accurate results for exceedance probabilities less
than or equal to 0.10 (10-yr return period).

###### PRNG Seed

A seed is a number used to initialize the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) in the stochastic simulation. The "auto" setting creates a default seed of 12345. The user can define a
new PRNG seed if desired. The seed is used to initialize the PRNG sequence of random numbers. The same seed will always produce the exact same sequence of random numbers,
thus producing the same simulation results (i.e., the seed ensures repeatability of results).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-123"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure123.png"
  alt="PRNG seed options."
  caption="PRNG seed options."

#### Output Options

/>

##### Frequency Curves

The user can select which frequency curves the simulation should develop. There are three options:
- Stage-Frequency Curve (this is the default)
- Peak Discharge-Frequency Curve
- Discharge-Duration-Frequency Curve
   - This option requires a duration to be set. The RMC-RFA simulation framework relies on the critical duration. As such, discharge-duration-frequency curves will be more accurate for 
   durations at least as long as the critical inflow duration.

Reservoir discharge-frequency relationships are often useful for assessing spillway erosion failure modes. For details on the plots created with each of these options see Frequency Curve Plots.

##### Uncertainty Bounds

RMC-RFA has three options availble for uncertainty limits during the simulation. The user should select one from the drop-down menu. 90% bounds are the default.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-125"
