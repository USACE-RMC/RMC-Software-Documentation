# Working with RMC-RFA 

The following data should be gathered before creating an RMC-RFA project: 
- Water control manual. 
- Period of record inflow, outflow, and stage data. 
- Inflow hydrograph shape, data, preferably sub-daily. 
- Reservoir routing information, such as stage-storage-discharge relationships.

The following analyses should be performed external to RMC-RFA prior to creating an RMC-RFA project: 
- Critical inflow duration analysis 
- Volume-duration-frequency analysis

This user's manual includes limited details on the data requirements or how to perform the above analyses. For greater detail, please consult the USACE hydrologic hazard assessment
methodology document <i> An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves for Dams</i>, Bulletin 17C <i>Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency</i>, and
Engineering Manual (EM) 1110-2-1415 <i>Hydrologic Frequency Analysis</i>.

## Launching RMC-RFA 

To start RMC-RFA navigate to Documents, open the RMC-RFA folder and select the RMC-RFA executable. If you have a shortcut created, or have pinned the program to the start menu
or task bar, the program can be opened by clicking on the RMC-RFA icon.

## Create a New Project 

The first step in performing an analysis with RMC-RFA is to establish which directory you wish to work in and to enter a title for the new project. To start a new project, go to the File menu
and select New Project. This will open the Create New Project window shown below:

/>

A new project can also be created by clicking the *New Project* button in the Tool Bar.

/>

The user is required to enter a name, select a unit system, and determine a project location. Adding a description of the study is optional,
but can be beneficial. Once you have entered all the information, click Create. After clicking Create, the project name will be listed in the project explorer, and the user is ready to input data.
Projects will be saved with the extension .rfa.sqlite. In a file folder they will have the project name followed by the extension.

**Note**: All names must be limited to 50 characters and cannot include any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].

## Open an Existing Project 

An existing project can be opened from the menu bar, by clicking *File→Open Project* or by selecting the project from a list of recent projects under *File→Recent Projects*.

Additionally, an existing project can be opened by clicking the *open project* icon in the tool bar.
