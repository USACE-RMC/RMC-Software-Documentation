# Working with RMC-RFA 

The following data should be gathered before creating an RMC-RFA project: 
- Water control manual. 
- Period of record inflow, outflow, and stage data. 
- Inflow hydrograph shape, data, preferably sub-daily. 
- Reservoir routing information, such as stage-storage-discharge relationships.

The following analyses should be performed external to RMC-RFA prior to creating an RMC-RFA project: 
- Critical inflow duration analysis 
- Volume-duration-frequency analysis

This user's manual includes limited details on the data requirements or how to perform the above analyses. For greater detail, please consult the USACE hydrologic hazard assessment
methodology document <i> An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves for Dams</i>, Bulletin 17C <i>Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency</i>, and
Engineering Manual (EM) 1110-2-1415 <i>Hydrologic Frequency Analysis</i>.

  caption="RMC-RFA desktop shortcut."
/>

## Create a New Project 

The first step in performing an analysis with RMC-RFA is to establish which directory you wish to work in and to enter a title for the new project. To start a new project, go to the File menu
and select New Project. This will open the Create New Project window shown below:

  alt="Location of New Project button in the tool bar."
  caption="Location of New Prohect button in the tool bar."
/>

The user is required to enter a name, select a unit system, and determine a project location. Adding a description of the study is optional,
but can be beneficial. Once you have entered all the information, click Create. After clicking Create, the project name will be listed in the project explorer, and the user is ready to input data.
Projects will be saved with the extension .rfa.sqlite. In a file folder they will have the project name followed by the extension.

**Note**: All names must be limited to 50 characters and cannot include any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].

## Open an Existing Project 

An existing project can be opened from the menu bar, by clicking *File→Open Project* or by selecting the project from a list of recent projects under *File→Recent Projects*.

## Input Data 

There are four types of input data required for a RMC-RFA project.

- Discharge Gage
- Inflow Hydrograph 
- Stage Gage
- Volume frequency Curve 

**NOTE**: Raw data investigation is the most important step in any dam safety analysis. Many data sets have numerous occurrences of missing data, faulty data, or other issues that can
impact analysis. The quality of the data that is analyzed will make the largest impact on the quality of results obtained from any computer program. In addition, know what data records are
available, and how / when any operational changes have been executed. If analysis relies on a period of record, the entire dataset used needs to be homogeneous and not from mixed
records or periods.

### Interpolate Missing Data 

Interpolate missing data is an option on the tables for discharge gage, inflow hydrograph, and stage gage. This function interpolates missing data from one defined ordinate to another
along a straight line. If a second cell/ordinate is not defined, the interpolate function will fill data in to the end of the table, along a straight line interval.

  caption="Input data with interpolated missing data. Note the new data is in red, as the data has not been saved yet."
/>

### Discharge Gage

The first set of data required to perform a simulation is a record of the inflows at the dam. The entire Period of Record (POR) should be used when available and appropriate. This data
should be a continuous record. Note that when you create a new discharge gage, the time step option is set to 1-day and cannot be changed. This is because the discharge gage and
stage gage require a mandatory 1-day time step. Daily averaged data for the POR is preferred. If the data is not in 1-day time step, it can easily be calculated from a 15-min time step or
hourly time step using the math function in HEC-DSSVue. Discharge gage data is used for computing Flood Seasonality and Empirical Frequency Curves.

1. **Name and Description** 
- You must enter a name, all names are limited to 50 characters and cannot include the any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].
- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Time Window**
- Select a start date and an end date for the inflow data you have available.
- Hit *Resize Table*

3. **Input Data Table**
- After hitting resize table the Input Data Table will populate with ordinates, data, and time.
- Manually enter or copy in the flows for the entire data set.

4. **Plot**
- When data has been entered the plot will generate. The plot has all the same features described in *Chart Features*.

  alt="Discharge gage input window filled out for Sayers Dam."
  caption="Discharge gage input window filled out for Sayers Dam."
/>


### Inflow Hydrograph 

Inflow hydrographs for major historical events, large events, or synthetic events should be entered. The shape of the hydrograph is a reflection of the response of the watershed to an
event. At least one inflow hydrograph shape is required to perform a simulation. Multiple inflow hydrographs can be sampled as part of the simulation. The inflow hydrograph shape is
scaled up or down based on the sampled inflow volume in the stochastic simulation.

- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Time Window**
- Select a start date and an end date for the inflow hydrograph.
- Select a timestep from the drop down menu. Four time steps are available in this input data window; 15 min, 1 hour, 6 hour, and daily.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-60"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure60.png"
  alt="Time step options for inflow hydrographs."
  caption="Time step options for inflow hydrographs."
/>

- Hit *Resize Table* 

3. **Input Data Table** 
- After hitting resize table the Input Data Table will populate with ordinates, date, and time.
- Manually enter or copy in the flows for the entire hydrograph.

4. **Plot**
- When data has been entered the plot will generate. The plot has all the same features described in *Chart Features*.

<Figure

  alt="Inflow hydrograph filled out for Sayer's Dam."
  caption="Inflow hydrograph filled out for Sayer's Dam."
/>

**Note on selecting an inflow hydrograph**: An observed inflow hydrograph from a major event should be used if at all possible. However, if no such events are available, a
synthetic event, such as the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) hydrograph may be utilized. For this type of analysis, the inflow hydrograph should be unregulated.

**Note on time step**: Verify that your inflow hydrograph shapes are inputted in one of the options for time steps. If your inflow data is in a different increment it can easily be converted
to a longer duration increment using the math function “change time interval” under the tools menu in HEC-DSSVue.

### Stage Gage

For stages, the entire Period of Record (POR) for the current operation procedures should be used when available and appropriate. This data should be a continuous record. Note that
when you create a new stage gage, the time step option is set to 1-day and cannot be changed. This is because the discharge gage and stage gage require a mandatory 1-day time step.
Daily averaged data for the POR is preferred. If the data is not in 1-day time step, it can easily be calculated from a 15-min time step or hourly time step using the math function in HECDSSVue.
Stage gage data is used to compute *Reservoir Starting Stage Duration* curves and *Empirical Frequency Curves*.

3. **Input Data Table**
- After hitting *Resize Table* the Input Data Table will populate with ordinates, date, and time.
- Manually enter or copy in the stages for the entire data set.

4. **Plot**

### Volume Frequency Curve

Prior to creating a new volume frequency curve, the following analyses should be performed external to RMC-RFA:
- Critical inflow duration analysis
- Volume-duration-frequency analysis

For greater detail, please consult the USACE hydrologic hazard assessment methodology document *An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves for Dams*,
Bulletin 17C *Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency, and Engineering Manual* (EM) 1110-2-1415 *Hydrologic Frequency Analysis*.

/>

1. **Name & Description**
- You must enter a name, all names are limited to 50 characters and cannot include the any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].
- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. ** Parameters**
- Select a Probability Distribution.
- Enter distribution parameters as mean of log, standard deviation of log, and skew of log.
-  Enter the equivalent years of record.
    - The equivalent years of record impacts the estimated uncertainty bounds. The longer the years of record, the smaller the knowledge uncertainty in the form of sampling error.
      See the Basic Framework section for more detail.
- Enter the duration in days
    -The duration should correspond to the critical inflow duration, which is defined as the inflow duration that results in the highest water surface elevations for the reservoir of
interest.
-After the parameters are entered, click the *compute* button. 

3. **Tabular Results**
- After computing the Tabular Results will be populated. RMC-RFA only provides 90% uncertainty bounds as default.

4.**Plot**
- After computing, the Plot will be generated. RMC-RFA only provides 90%uncertainty bounds as default.

  alt="Volume Frequency curve after computing for Sayer's Dam."
  caption="Volume Frequency curve after computing for Sayer's Dam."
/>

#### Parameters 

The following parameters need to be determined before computing volume frequency curve:
- Probability Distribution
-  Mean (of log)
- Standard Deviation (of log)
- Skew (of log)
- Equivalent Years of Record
- Duration

  alt="Parameters for volume frequency curve."
  caption="Volume Frequency curve after computing for Sayer's Dam."
/>

##### Probability Distributions

In RMC-RFA, inflow volume-frequency relationships can be defined using the Log Normal, Log Gumbel, Log Pearson Type III, or Log Generalized Extreme Value distribution, allowing the
user to also assess the range of uncertainty in reservoir stage-frequency due to statistical model selection. The Log Pearson Type III distribution is the default distribution in RMC-RFA. In
the current version of RMC-RFA all probability distributions require input parameters in log space.

  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure69.png"
  alt="Parameters for volume frequency curve."
  caption="Probability distributions for volume frequency curve."
/>

**Note on Selecting a Probability Distribution**
In general, follow the guidance outlined in the USACE hydrologic hazard assessment methodology document An Inflow Volume-Based Approach to Estimating Stage-Frequency Curves
for Dams, Bulletin 17C Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency, and Engineering Manual (EM) 1110-2-1415 Hydrologic Frequency Analysis. USACE recommends using the Log
Pearson Type III for flow frequency. However, there are cases where a user will want to evaluate the sensitivity associated with selecting a different model. General guidance for
distribution selection is provided below and summarized from Predictive Hydrology: A Frequency Analysis Approach by Meylan et al.

- Log Normal: Many probability distributions can be transformed by replacing the variate with its logarithmic value. The annual maximum flow series are typically not represented well by
the Normal distribution. The data is skewed to right because flows are only positive in magnitude (whereas a Normal distribution will include negative flows). When the data is leftbounded
(cannot be less than zero) and positively skewed, a logarithmic transformation of the data may allow the use of the Log Normal distribution. It can be argued that the
occurrence of a flood results from the combination of a large number of multiplying factors (Chow, 1954). Therefore, the central limit theorem leads to the conclusion that annual
maximum flows follow a Log Normal distribution because the product of n variables yields to the sum of n logarithms.

- Log Gumbel: This is a two-parameter distribution in the generalized extreme value family (EV Type 1). The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the GEV where γ = 0 (See
section on GEV below). Peak and short duration flood events It is widely used due to its ease of use.

- Log Pearson Type III (LPIII): This distribution is also called the three-parameter Gamma distribution. Since 1967, the US water Resource Council has recommended and required the
use of LPIII distributions for all US flow frequency analysis for flood insurance purposes. This distribution is flexible and usually applied to volumes corresponding to annual maximum
floods. However, it should be noted that the volumes are not maximum values in the statistical sense since peak floods that are lower but of longer duration can still produce larger
volumes.

- Generalized Extreme Value (GEV): This is a flexible three-parameter distribution in the Extreme Value family that combines the Gumbel, Frechet and Weibull distribution. From the
standpoint of the asymptotic theory, the GEV represents the distribution of the maximum of n random variables, and is often considered the most appropriate for modeling flow
frequency.

##### Equivalent Years of Record 

The equivalent years of record impacts the estimated uncertainty bounds.The longer in tthe years of record, the smaller the knowledge uncertainty in the form of sampling error.

##### Duration

The duration should correspond to the cricial inflow duration, which is defined as the inflow duration that results in the highest water surface elevations for the reservoir of interest.

#### Tabular Results

Right click on the Tabular Results and a context menu will appear as shown in the figure below. The user can select all, copy, and copy with table headers. However, the user cannot
paste into or edit the table data.

## Analyses

There are three analyses that should be performed for a RMC-RFA project:
- Flood Seasonality
- Reservoir Starting Stage Duration
- Empirical Frequency Curve

### Flood Seasonality 

The term *flood seasonality* is intended to describe the frequency of occurrence of rare floods on a seasonal basis, where a rare flood is defined as any event where the flow exceeds some
user specified threshold for a specified flow duration. This approach is commonly referred to as the “Peak-Over-Threshold” method.

Flood seasonality information is required in many applications in hydrology and water resources, such as seasonal streamflow forecasting, flood protection, and water resources
infrastructure operations. For the purposes of the hydrologic hazard assessment of dams, flood seasonality information tells us which season an extreme flood event is most likely to
occur. The information can also provide insight on mixed populations in meteorology. For example, a reservoir in the west will likely have a snowmelt season and a rainy season. Flood
seasonality information can also be important if the reservoir is operated with seasonal guide curves. In many flood control reservoirs, the pool is lowered ahead of the rainy season in
order to provide more storage ahead of any large flood events.

1. **Name & Description** 
- You must enter a name, all names are limited to 50 characters and cannot include the any special characters [!”#$%&’()*+,\./:;< = >? @^`{}~].
- Descriptions have no special character restrictions, and allow for up to 2,000 characters, allowing a user to provide significant detail for any project component.

2. **Parameters**
- Select a discharge gage to use in the analysis.
- Enter the threshold flow, critical duration, maximum events per year, and the minimum days between events. See the Parameters section for details.
- After the parameters are entered, click the compute button.

3. **Tabular Results**
- After computing, the Tabular Results will be populated.

4. **Plot**
- After computing, the Plot will be generated.

  alt="Flood seasonality after computing for Sayer's Dam."
  caption="Flood seasonality after computing for Sayer's Dam."
/>

#### Parameters 

The following parameters need to be determined before computing flood seasonality:
- Discharge Gage
- Threshold Flow
- Critical Duration
- Maximum Events Per Year
- Minimum Days Between Events

<Figure
  figKey="figure-74"
  src="figures/desktop-applications/rmc-rfa/users-guide/v1.0/figures/figure74.png"
  alt="Parameters for flood seasonality."
  caption="Parameters for flood seasonality."
/>

##### Threshold Flow 

The threshold flow is usually chosen as a flow that corresponds to a specified frequency level (i.e. 2-year, 5-year or 10-year return period) for a specified critical duration to provide a
common measure or rareness of the flood. There are two conflicting goals in selecting a threshold for identifying rare floods:

1. The threshold needs to be high enough so that large events are considered in the analysis.
2. There needs to be a dataset large enough to reduce uncertainties arising from sampling error.

Considering the two goals, the threshold needs to be set to as rare a frequency level as possible that will still provide a sufficiently large sample size. Sample sizes of 30-40 flood events
are usually adequate.

Determining an appropriate threshold flow to meet this criteria is an iterative process that requires a VDF curve for the critical duration, as described in the Volume Frequency Curve
section.

##### Critical Duration 

Enter the critical duration in days. This should be the same critical duration chosen the Volume Frequency Curve. The critical duration should remain the same for the simulation.

##### Max Events Per Year

RMC-RFA will filter the period of record based on the threshold flow and critical duration. However, the resulting sample set may not be large enough to reduce uncertainties arising from
sampling error. Therefore, in order to meet the second criterion above, a partial-duration series technique can be employed. A partial-duration series represents the occurrence of all
independent events of interest, regardless of whether two or more occurred in the same year. Caution must be exercised in selecting the maximum number of events per year and the
days between events to ensure the events are hydrologically independent.

##### Min Days Between Events

This parameter is used in conjunction with the “Maximum events per year” option. The minimum number of days between events is used to identify independent flood events. For
example, if the critical inflow duration is two days, then a minimum of 7 days between events should be sufficient to ensure independence. The minimum number of days between events
can also be determined by visual inspection of the flow time series to see the typical time between large flow events.

#### Tabular Results

The Tabular Results are presented on two tabs:
1. Seasonal Frequency
2. Flood Events

##### Seasonal Frequency

The user can choose to *Allow Manual Data Entry*, which will enable the user to edit the *Frequency* column of the *Seasonal Frequency* table as shown below. This option
is included in RMC-RFA so that users can use flood seasonality estimates developed external of RMC-RFA.

**Note**: When data has been manually entered, this will be reflected in the plot. Any manually entered storms will not appear in the Flood Events tab.

##### Flood Events

Right click on the Flood Events table and a context menu will appear as shown in the figure below. The user can select all, copy, and copy with table headers. However, the user cannot
paste into or edit the table data.
