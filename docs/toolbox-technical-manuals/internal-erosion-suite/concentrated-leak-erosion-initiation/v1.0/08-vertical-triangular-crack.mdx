# Vertical Triangular Crack

## Method of Analysis

The method of analysis is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.1.

## Critical Shear Stress and Initial Crack Dimensions

The critical shear stress and initial crack dimensions are the same as that described for the Vertical Rectangular Crack worksheet in section 7.2.

## Core Geometry

The core geometry is the same as that described for the Vertical Rectangular Crack worksheet in section 7.3.

## Hydraulic Shear Stress

The hydraulic shear stress on the surface of the vertical triangular crack from flow of water in the crack is the same as that described for the
Vertical Rectangular Crack worksheet in section 7.4, but using a different equation. <EquationReference equationKey="equation-10" /> calculates the
hydraulic shear stress on the isosceles triangular surface of the vertical triangular crack.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-10"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}W}{6DL} \frac{(H_{1}^{3} - H_{2}^{3})}{(H_{1}+H_{2})\sqrt{1+ \frac{W^2}{4D^2}}}"
/>

## Likelihood of Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

The likelihood of initiation of concentrated leak erosion is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.5, but using a
 different equation and crack width instead of pipe diameter.

## Headwater Level for Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

The headwater level for initiation of concentrated leak erosion is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.6, but
using a different equation and crack width instead of pipe diameter.

## Critical Crack Width for Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

The critical crack width at the top of the core for initiation of concentrated leak erosion is the same as that described for the Vertical Rectangular
 Crack worksheet in section 7.7, but using a different equation. <EquationReference equationKey="equation-11" /> calculates the critical crack width
at the top of the core for initiation of concentrated leak erosion for each headwater level and the specified crack depth from the top of the core.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-11"
  equation="W_{cr} = \frac{\tau_{c}(H_{1}+H_{2})}{\sqrt{ \frac{\gamma_{W}^{2}(H_{1}^{3} - H_{2}^{3})^2}{36D^{2}L^{2}} - \frac{\tau_{c}^{2}(H_{1}+H_{2})^{2}}{4D^2} }}"
