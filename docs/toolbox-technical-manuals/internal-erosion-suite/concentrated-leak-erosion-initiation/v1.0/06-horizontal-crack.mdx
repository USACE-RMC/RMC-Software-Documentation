# Horizontal Crack

## Method of Analysis

The method of analysis is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.1.

## Critical Shear Stress and Initial Crack Dimensions

The critical shear stress and initial crack dimensions are very similar to that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.2. Instead
of entering an initial pipe diameter, input the initial crack width. In addition, step 2 includes an input for the crack width parallel to the
embankment centerline (X) as <FigReference figKey="figure-31" /> illustrates.

/>

## Core Geometry

The core geometry is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.3.

## Hydraulic Shear Stress

The hydraulic shear stress on the surface of the horizontal crack from flow of water in the crack is the same as that described for the Cylindrical
Pipe worksheet in section 5.4, but using a different equation and crack width instead of pipe diameter. The hydraulic shear stress on the rectangular
surface of the horizontal crack is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-6" />.

where:

- <em>W</em> = initial crack width
- <em>X</em> = crack width parallel to the embankment centerline

## Likelihood of Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

The likelihood of initiation of concentrated leak erosion is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.5, but using
crack width instead of pipe diameter.

## Headwater Level for Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

The headwater level for initiation of concentrated leak erosion is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section 5.6, but
using crack width instead of pipe diameter.

## Critical Crack Width for Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

The critical pipe diameter for initiation of concentrated leak erosion is the same as that described for the Cylindrical Pipe worksheet in section
5.7, but using a different equation and crack width instead of pipe diameter. <EquationReference equationKey="equation-7" /> calculates the critical
crack width for initiation of concentrated leak erosion for each headwater level.

  equation="W_{cr} = \frac{-2L\tau_{c}X}{2L\tau_{c} - \gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})X}"
