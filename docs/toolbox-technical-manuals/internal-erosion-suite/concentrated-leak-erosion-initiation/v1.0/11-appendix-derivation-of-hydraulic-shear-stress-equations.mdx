# Appendix A - Derivation of Hydraulic Shear Stress Equations

Each of the following four derivations of hydraulic shear stress on the surface of a continuous flaw (crack, gap, or pipe) from flow of water in the
flaw is based on these simplifying assumptions:

- Cross-section of the flaw is uniform from upstream to downstream (waterside to landside).

- Steady uniform flow occurs through the flaw.

- Head loss is linear from upstream to downstream (waterside to landside).

- Frictional resistance is uniform along the surface of the flaw.

- Frictional resistance is equal to the driving force.

Equation A-1 approximates the average hydraulic shear stress acting on the pipe by assuming static equilibrium.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-12"
  equation="\sum F = \gamma_{W}H_{1}\frac{\pi D^2}{4}-\tau(\pi D)L-\gamma_{W}H_{2}\frac{\pi D^2}{4} = 0"
/>

where:

- <em>F</em> = force
- <em>D</em> = diameter of the pipe
- <em>L</em> = length of the pipe
- <em>H<sub>1</sub></em> = hydraulic head at upstream end of pipe (headwater elevation minus base of pipe elevation)
- <em>H<sub>2</sub></em> = hydraulic head at downstream end of pipe (tailwater elevation minus base of pipe elevation)
- <em>&gamma;<sub>w</sub></em> = unit weight of water
- <em>&tau;</em> = average hydraulic shear stress

Solving for the average hydraulic shear stress results in Equations A-2 and A-3.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-13"
  equation="\tau(\pi D)L = \gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})\frac{\pi D^2}{4}"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-14"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})D}{4L}"
/>

Equation A-4 calculates the average hydraulic gradient across the flow path.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-15"
  equation="i=\frac{H_{1}-H_2}{L}"
/>

Therefore, Equation A-3 can be rewritten as Equation A-5.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-16"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}iD}{4}"
/>
Alternatively, the average hydraulic shear stress acting on the walls of the pipe can be approximated by a more general formula for the hydraulic
shear stress along a pipe as shown in Equation A-6.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-17"
  equation="\tau = \gamma_{W}i\frac{A}{P_W}"
/>
where:

- <em>A</em> = average cross-sectional area of the flow

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-18"
  equation="A=\frac{\pi D^2}{4}"
/>

- <em>P<sub>W</sub></em> = average wetted perimeter

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-19"
  equation="P_{W} = \pi D"
/>

Substituting Equations A-4, A-7, and A-8 into Equation A-6 results in Equations A-9, A-10, and A-11.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-20"
  equation="\tau = \gamma_{W}\left(\frac{H_{1}-H_{2}}{L}\right)\left(\frac{\left(\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\right)}{\pi D}\right)"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-21"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})D}{4L}"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-22"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}iD}{4}"
/>

Solving Equation A-10 for the pipe diameter and setting <em>&tau;</em>  = <em>&tau;</em><sub>c</sub> (critical shear stress) results in the critical pipe
diameter for initiation of concentrated leak erosion (<em>D<sub>cr</sub></em>) as shown in Equations A-12, A-13, and A-14.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-23"
  equation="\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})D = 4L\tau_{c}"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-24"
  equation="D_{cr} = \frac{4L\tau_c}{\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_2)}"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-25"
  equation="D_{cr} = \frac{4L\tau_c}{\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_2)}"

Equation A-15 approximates the average hydraulic shear stress acting on the crack by assuming static equilibrium.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-26"
  equation="\sum F = \gamma_{W}H_{1}WX-\tau(2WL+2XL)-\gamma_{W}H_{2}WX = 0"
/>

where:

- <em>F</em> = force
- <em>W</em> = vertical crack dimension (crack width)
- <em>X</em> = horizontal crack dimension (crack width parallel to the embankment centerline)
- <em>L</em> = length of the crack
- <em>H<sub>1</sub></em> = hydraulic head at upstream end of crack (headwater elevation minus base of crack elevation)
- <em>H<sub>2</sub></em> = hydraulic head at downstream end of crack (tailwater elevation minus base of crack elevation)
- <em>&gamma;<sub>w</sub></em> = unit weight of water
- <em>&tau;</em> = average hydraulic shear stress

Solving for the average hydraulic shear stress results in Equations A-16 and A-17.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-27"
  equation="\tau(2WL+2XL) = \gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})WX"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-28"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_2)WX}{L(2W+2X)}"
/>

Equation A-18 calculates the average hydraulic gradient across the flow path.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-29"
  equation="i=\frac{H_{1}-H_2}{L}"
/>


Therefore, Equation A-17 can be rewritten as Equation A-19.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-30"
  equation="\tau=\frac{\gamma_{W}iWX}{2W+2X}"
/>

Alternatively, the average hydraulic shear stress acting on the walls of the crack can be approximated by a more general formula for the hydraulic
shear stress along a crack as shown in Equation A-20.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-31"
  equation="\tau =\gamma_{W}i\frac{A}{P_W}"
/>

where:

- <em>A</em> = average cross-sectional area of the flow

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-32"
  equation="A=WX"
/>

- <em>P<sub>w</sub></em> = average wetted perimeter

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-33"
  equation="P_{W} = 2W+2X"
/>

Substituting Equations A-18, A-21, and A-22 into Equation A-20 results in Equations A-23, A-24, and A-25.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-34"
  equation="\tau = \gamma_{W}\left(\frac{H_{1}-H_2}{L}\right)\left(\frac{WX}{2W+2X}\right)"
/>

<Equation

  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})WX}{L(2W+2X)}"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-36"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}iWX}{2W+2X}"
/>

Solving Equation A-24 for the crack width (vertical crack dimension) and setting <em>&tau;</em>  = <em>&tau;</em><sub>c</sub> (critical shear stress) results
in the critical crack width for initiation of concentrated leak erosion (<em>W<sub>cr</sub></em>) as shown in Equations A-26 to A-31.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-37"
  equation="L\tau_c(2W+2X) = \gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})WX"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-38"
  equation="L\tau_c(2W+2X) - \gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})WX = 0"
/>


<Equation
  equationKey="equation-39"
  equation="2L\tau_{c}W+2L\tau_{c}X- \gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_{2})WX = 0"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-40"
  equation="W[2L\tau_{c}-\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_2)X] = -2L\tau_{c}X"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-41"
  equation="W_{cr} = \frac{-2L\tau_{c}X}{2L\tau_{c}-\gamma_{W}(H_{1}-H_2)X}"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-42"
  equation="W_{cr} = \frac{-2\tau_{c}X}{2L\tau_{c}-\gamma_{W}iX}"
/>


Because <EquationNoRef equation="W<<X"/>, the average hydraulic shear stress in Equation A-25 can be approximated as shown in Equations A-32 and A-33.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-43"
  equation="\tau = \frac{\gamma_{W}iWX}{2(0)+2X}"
/>

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-44"
  equation="\tau \approx \frac{\gamma_{W}iW}{2}"
/>

Solving Equation A-33 for the crack width and setting <em>&tau;</em>  = <em>&tau;</em><sub>c</sub> (critical shear stress) results in the critical crack width
 for initiation of concentrated leak erosion as shown in Equation A-34.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-45"
  equation="W_{cr} \approx \frac{2\tau_c}{\gamma_{W}i}"

  equation="\sum F = \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{W}H_{1}^{2}W-\tau(2L\left(\frac{H_{1}+H_2}{2}\right)+WL)-\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{W}H_{2}^{2}W=0"

where:

Alternatively, the average hydraulic shear stress acting on the walls of the crack can be approximated by a more general formula for the hydraulic
shear stress along a crack as shown in Equation A-38.

<Equation

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-54"
  equation="P_{W}=H_{1}+H_{2}+W"

Substituting Equations A-39, A-41, and A-43 into Equation A-38 results in Equations A-44 and A-45.

<Equation

Solving Equation A-45 for the crack width at the top of the core and setting <em></em>  = <em></em><sub>c</sub> (critical shear stress) results in
the critical crack width for initiation of concentrated leak erosion (<em>W<sub>cr</sub></em>) as shown in Equations A-46 to A-50.

Because <em>H<sub>2</sub></em> is often zero (i.e., no tailwater) and <EquationNoRef equation="W<<H_1"/>, the average hydraulic shear stress in Equation A-45
