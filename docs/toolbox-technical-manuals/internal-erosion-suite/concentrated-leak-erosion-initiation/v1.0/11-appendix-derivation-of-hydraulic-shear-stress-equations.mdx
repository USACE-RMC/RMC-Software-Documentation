# Appendix A - Derivation of Hydraulic Shear Stress Equations

Each of the following four derivations of hydraulic shear stress on the surface of a continuous flaw (crack, gap, or pipe) from flow of water in the
flaw is based on these simplifying assumptions:

- Cross-section of the flaw is uniform from upstream to downstream (waterside to landside).

- Steady uniform flow occurs through the flaw.

- Head loss is linear from upstream to downstream (waterside to landside).

- Frictional resistance is uniform along the surface of the flaw.

- Frictional resistance is equal to the driving force.

Because <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> is often zero (i.e., no tailwater) and <EquationNoRef equation="W<<D"/>, the average hydraulic shear stress in Equation A-84 can
be approximated as shown in Equations A-92, A-93, and A-94.

Solving Equation A-94 for the crack width and setting <em></em>  = <em><sub>c</sub></em> (critical shear stress) results in the critical crack width
 for initiation of concentrated leak erosion as shown in Equation A-95.
