# Cylindrical Pipe

## Method of Analysis

In step 1, use the drop-down list to select the method of analysis (probabilistic or deterministic). There are two options for probabilistic analysis.
The first performs 1,000 iterations (judged adequate for most applications) without using Palisade’s @RISK software. This provides flexibility if an
@RISK software license is not available. The second uses @RISK to customize the probabilistic analysis. Use the drop-down list to select Yes if @RISK
is used and No if @RISK is not used. <FigReference figKey="figure-9" /> through <FigReference figKey="figure-11" /> illustrate the three possible
scenarios.

## Critical Shear Stress and Initial Pipe Diameter

In step 2, input the critical shear stress for the embankment core and initial pipe diameter. The selections in step 1 affect the input for step 2,
and cells that do not apply have a gray background. These cells are not used in subsequent calculations, even if data is present.

For deterministic analysis, input only the most likely values. The mean values used for subsequent calculations are the most likely (or mode) value.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-12" /> illustrates the deterministic input.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-12"

  alt="Step 2 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Deterministic analysis."
  caption="Step 2 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Deterministic analysis."
/>

For probabilistic analysis without using @RISK, input the minimum and maximum values in addition to the most likely value, and triangular
distributions represent the random variables. The mean values used in subsequent calculations are the average of the minimum, most likely, and maximum
values. <FigReference figKey="figure-13" /> illustrates the probabilistic input without @RISK.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-13"

  alt="Step 2 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Probabilistic analysis without using @RISK."
  caption="Step 2 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Probabilistic analysis without using @RISK."
/>

For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, input the minimum, most likely, and maximum values, and use an @RISK formula for a triangular distribution in
the third column as a default. Alternatively, input a valid @RISK distribution in lieu of this default formula, and the user-specified input displays
in the fourth column. The mean values used for subsequent calculations are the means for the @RISK distributions entered in the third column.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-14" /> illustrates the probabilistic input using @RISK.

The RMC Erodibility Parameters Toolbox helps estimate the critical shear stress of the embankment core. The toolbox contains empirical relationships
and published values based on field and laboratory testing. The RMC Concentrated Leak Erosion (Cracking) Toolbox helps estimate the initial pipe
diameter. Because it is very difficult to predict the initial pipe diameter, sensitivity analysis is recommended.

If using @RISK to perform probabilistic analysis, delete unnecessary calculation worksheets because the simulation is performed for all worksheets in
the workbook, which is time consuming. If cycling through iterations using @RISK, the displayed results are no longer mean values of the random variables;
they are the selected iteration’s values.

The remaining input for step 2 is the base of pipe elevation. When setting up this worksheet, include a headwater partition for the base of pipe
elevation. The probability of initiation of concentrated leak erosion is zero at and below this elevation.

## Core Geometry

In step 3, the embankment core geometry is defined. Input includes the top of the core elevation, width at the top of the core, and slope data for the
core. Slopes are defined by elevation, starting at the top of the core and ending at the base of the embankment. <FigReference figKey="figure-15" />
illustrates the core geometry input. Step 4 uses the slopes of the embankment core to calculate the pipe length over which the hydraulic head
difference occurs. Therefore, the lowest core elevation (minimum z<sub>bot</sub>) must be less than or equal to the base of pipe elevation to compute
the length. A caution displays with an orange background if the minimum user-specified z<sub>bot</sub> for the upstream or downstream slope of the
core is greater than base of pipe elevation.

  alt="Step 3 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Core geometry."
  caption="Step 3 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Core geometry."
/>

## Hydraulic Shear Stress

Step 4 calculates the hydraulic shear stress on the surface of the cylindrical pipe from flow of water in the pipe as shown in
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-3" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-3" equation="\tau = \gamma_{W}i\frac{D}{4}" />

where:

- <em>D</em> = initial diameter of the pipe

The average hydraulic gradient used in <EquationReference equationKey="equation-3" /> is calculated by dividing the net hydraulic head across the
pipe by the length at the base of the pipe for each defined headwater-tailwater combination.

For a homogenous embankment, the pipe length is measured at the base elevation of the pipe as a straight line from the upstream slope of the
embankment to the downstream slope. For a zoned embankment where the upstream and downstream zones are very permeable (e.g., rockfill), the pipe
length is measured as a straight line at the base elevation of the pipe from the upstream slope of the impervious core to the downstream slope of the
impervious core. Override the formula for pipe length with a user-specified length for embankments with sloping cores, pipe orientations that are not
perpendicular to the embankment centerline, etc.

The hydraulic shear stress calculated at the bottom of the first table in <FigReference figKey="figure-16" /> is for the mean initial pipe diameter.
Because some uncertainty is always present regarding the input parameters for this type of analysis, the second table reports the hydraulic shear
stress using the same hydraulic conditions as the first table but for pipe diameters ranging from 1 millimeter to 150 millimeters. The second table is
used in step 6 to estimate the critical pipe diameter.

  alt="Step 4 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Hydraulic shear stress."
  caption="Step 4 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Hydraulic shear stress."
/>

## Likelihood of Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

Step 5 compares the calculated hydraulic shear stress on the surface of the cylindrical pipe from flow of water in the pipe to the critical shear
stress for initiation of concentrated leak erosion. The factor of safety (FS) against initiation of concentrated leak erosion is calculated as shown
in <EquationReference equationKey="equation-4" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-4" equation="FS=\frac{\tau_{cr}}{\tau}" />

where:

- <em>
    &tau;<sub>cr</sub>
  </em>
  = critical shear stress for initiation of concentrated leak erosion
- <em>&tau;</em>= hydraulic shear stress on the surface of the cylindrical pipe from flow of water
  in the pipe

For deterministic analysis, the mean hydraulic shear stress is plotted for each headwater level as a function of pipe diameter and results in a series
of straight lines. The mean and mode initial pipe diameter and critical shear stress defined in step 2 are plotted as a point on the chart. When this
point plots above the line of the headwater level being considered, the FS is greater than 1, and initiation of concentrated leak erosion is not
predicted. When this point plots below the line, the FS is less than 1, and initiation is predicted. Cells that do not apply have a gray background.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-17" /> illustrates the graphical output of hydraulic shear stress for deterministic analysis.

  caption="Step 5 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Graphical output of hydraulic shear stress for deterministic analysis."
/>

For probabilistic analysis, a black box is also plotted showing the distribution limits for initial pipe diameter and critical shear stress.
Initiation is predicted for initial pipe diameter and critical shear stress combinations that plot inside the black box and below the line
corresponding to the headwater level being evaluated. If cycling through iterations using @RISK, the displayed mean pipe diameter and critical shear
stress are no longer mean values; they are the selected iteration’s values. <FigReference figKey="figure-18" /> provides an example of the graphical
output of hydraulic shear stress for probabilistic analysis.

<FigReference figKey="figure-19" /> illustrates the plot options for this chart. The maximum value
for the y-axis (hydraulic shear stress) and maximum value for the x-axis (pipe diameter) are
user-specified.

  caption="Step 5 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Plot options for hydraulic shear stress."
/>

For deterministic analysis, the FS is calculated using the most likely values of the random variables and summarized in separate tables. Cells that do
not apply have a gray background. For probabilistic analysis, the FS is calculated as described for the deterministic analysis but for the mean
values of the random variables, and multiple iterations are performed by sampling the distributions in step 6. The probability of initiation is equal
to the percentage of iterations that resulted in a FS less than 1 [(P(FS < 1)]. For probabilistic analysis performed without using @RISK, 1,000
iterations are used. For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, the number of iterations is user-specified, and “@RISK” displays in parentheses after the
number of iterations for this scenario. If cycling through iterations using @RISK, the displayed results are no longer mean values; they are the
selected iteration’s values. For deterministic and probabilistic analyses, cells with FS<em> </em>less than 1 have an orange background.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-20" /> illustrates the deterministic tabular output, and <FigReference figKey="figure-21" /> illustrates the
probabilistic tabular output without using @RISK.

At the end of step 5, summary plots are generated. The first plot is the mean FS against initiation of concentrated leak erosion as a function of
headwater level. A deterministic analysis uses only the mean critical shear stress and the mean initial pipe diameter. The result is plotted as a blue
line, and a gray background is applied to the drop-down list above the plot signifying it does not apply. A horizontal reference line is displayed in
black for a FS of 1.0. <FigReference figKey="figure-22" /> illustrates graphical output for deterministic analysis.

  caption="Step 5 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Graphical output of factor of safety for deterministic analysis."
/>

For probabilistic analysis, use the drop-down list above the plot to select a critical shear stress other than the mean for the FS calculation.
Options include the minimum, most likely, and maximum critical shear stress. Additionally, along with the mean initial pipe diameter, the FS against
for initiation of concentrated leak erosion is plotted for the minimum (green dashed line) and maximum (red dashed line) initial pipe diameter. If
cycling through iterations using @RISK, the plotted FS is calculated using the hydraulic shear stress for the selected iteration and the critical
shear stress from the drop-down list. <FigReference figKey="figure-23" /> provides an example of the graphical output for probabilistic analysis.

  caption="Step 5 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Graphical output of factor of safety for probabilistic analysis."
/>

<FigReference figKey="figure-24" /> illustrates the plot options for
<FigReference figKey="figure-23" />. The maximum value for the y-axis (FS against initiation of
concentrated leak erosion) and minimum and maximum values for the x-axis (headwater level) are
user-specified. Up to five vertical reference elevations can be defined with user-specified labels
displayed at the top of the chart.

The second plot is the probability of initiation of concentrated leak erosion as a function of headwater level. For deterministic analysis, a
probability of initiation of concentrated leak erosion is not calculated, and this plot has a gray background. For probabilistic analysis, the mean
probability of initiation of concentrated leak erosion displays. If cycling through iterations using @RISK, this plot has a gray background because
the probability of initiation cannot be calculated from a single iteration. Similarly, this plot has a gray background for deterministic analysis.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-25" /> illustrates the graphical output for probabilistic analysis.

<FigReference figKey="figure-26" /> illustrates the plot options for this chart. The vertical
reference elevations and minimum and maximum values for the x-axis (headwater level) are the same as
the previous chart. Only the maximum value for the y-axis (probability of initiation of concentrated
leak erosion) is user-specified.

## Headwater Level for Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

Step 6 calculates the headwater level for initiation of concentrated leak erosion. The results for different combinations of the initial pipe diameter
and critical shear stress are linearly interpolated from the tables in step 4. The first table (Distribution) considers the combinations created by
the distribution input in step 2 and is available only when probabilistic analysis is selected. For deterministic analysis, this table has a gray
background. The second table (Mean) considers the mean initial pipe diameter and the mean critical shear stress and is available for both
deterministic and probabilistic analyses. If the critical shear stress is less than the hydraulic shear stress for the minimum specified headwater
level, the headwater level for initiation so indicates. If the critical shear stress is greater than the hydraulic shear stress for the maximum
specified headwater level or if the hydraulic shear stress does not increase with an increase in headwater level (e.g., because of an increase in the
tailwater level), the headwater level for initiation cannot be calculated, and an error displays. For deterministic analysis, the mean value in the
second table is equal to the most likely (or mode) value. <FigReference figKey="figure-27" /> and <FigReference figKey="figure-28" /> provide
examples of critical headwater levels for deterministic and probabilistic analyses, respectively.

## Critical Pipe Diameter for Initiation of Concentrated Leak Erosion

Step 7 calculates the critical pipe diameter for initiation of concentrated leak erosion (<em>D<sub>cr</sub></em>) for each headwater level using
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-5" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-5" equation="D_{cr} = \frac{4\tau_c}{i\gamma_W}" />

This equation was derived by solving <EquationReference equationKey="equation-3" /> for the pipe diameter and setting the hydraulic shear stress
equal to the critical shear stress.

For deterministic analysis, the calculations for the minimum and maximum critical pipe diameters have a gray background, and the most likely (mode)
and mean critical pipe diameter are equal at each headwater level evaluated because the mode and mean critical shear stress are equal.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-29" /> provides an example for deterministic analysis.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-29"

  alt="Step 7 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Deterministic analysis."
  caption="Step 7 of Cylindrical Pipe worksheet: Deterministic analysis."
/>

For probabilistic analysis, the critical pipe diameter for each headwater level is calculated using the minimum, most likely (mode), maximum, and mean
critical shear stress, where <em>D<sub>cr,min</sub></em><sub> </sub>is based on the minimum <em>&tau;<sub>c</sub>; D<sub>cr,mode</sub></em> is based on
the most likely (mode) <em>&tau;<sub>c</sub></em>;<em> D<sub>cr,max</sub></em> is based on the maximum <em>&tau;<sub>c</sub></em>; and

<em>
  D<sub>cr,mean</sub>
</em>
is based on the mean
<em>
  &tau;<sub>c</sub>
</em>
. <FigReference figKey="figure-30" /> provides an example for probabilistic analysis.
