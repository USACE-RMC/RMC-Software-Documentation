# Sinkhole

This worksheet assesses the stability of residual soil as a function of potential soil void diameter to assess the impact of a sinkhole developing at
a given location on the of likelihood of breach. <Citation citationKey="Drumm2009" /> developed a dimensionless stability chart to evaluate the
stability of residual soils in karst where subsurface voids may exist near the rock contact and collapse of these voids may result in a sinkhole.

The sinkhole size and location and impounded water level at the time of the sinkhole are critical to evaluating the likelihood of breach due to
sinkhole development. If the sinkhole occurs near the embankment crest with an elevated water level, it may lower the crest quickly and lead to
overtopping with breach. If the sinkhole occurs downstream of the embankment centerline, progressive instability is needed to eventually cause loss of
 freeboard, but for this scenario, there is usually sufficient time for intervention and corrective action.

<FigReference figKey="figure-21" /> shows the idealized profile from <Citation citationKey="Drumm2009" /> with residual soil thickness (h) above a
subsurface void of diameter (<em>D</em>) overlying bedrock. A weak zone of thickness 3<em>D</em>/4 overlying the rock surface is also shown in the
figure, which is discussed in section 7.2.

<Figure

  alt="Axisymmetric idealization of residual soil with a void overlying bedrock."
  caption="Axisymmetric idealization of residual soil with a void overlying bedrock."
/>

The thickness (<em>h</em>) of the residual soil above the void at the rock surface is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-16" />
.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-16"
  equation="h = H - \frac{D}{2}"
/>

where:

- <em>H</em> = embankment height above the rock contact
- <em>D</em> = void diameter

Assuming no internal cavity pressure, the methodology compares a dimensionless stability number for a spherical void in residual soil overlying the
rock surface for undrained (short-term) and drained (long-term) conditions to a critical dimensionless stability number. From the results of the
numerical analyses, critical stability numbers were developed for different strength and geometric conditions as shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-22" />.

## Embankment Characterization

Step 1 characterizes the embankment. Input the unit weight of the residual clay soil and the height of the embankment as shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-23" />.

  caption="Step 1 of Sinkhole worksheet: Embankment characteristics."
/>

## Undrained Stability (Short-Term Conditions)

Step 2 assesses the stability of residual soils in karst, where subsurface voids may exist near the rock surface, under undrained (short-term)
conditions. Soils in karst often show a shear strength profile that decreases at depths near the rock contact, commonly known as an inverted residual
soil strength profile. To account for the reduction in shear strength, the evaluation of undrained conditions includes a reduced cohesion value
(<em>c<sup>&#42;</sup></em>) for a weak zone overlying rock with a thickness of 3<em>D</em> /4.

Input the undrained cohesion (<em>c</em>) of the residual soil above the weak zone and the reduced cohesion of the weak zone above the rock surface
(<em>c<sup>&#42;</sup></em>) with thickness 3<em>D</em> /4, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-24" />.

The dimensionless stability number (<em>N<sub>c&phi;</sub></em>) for undrained (short-term) conditions is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-17" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-17"
  equation="N_{c\phi} = \frac{\gamma h}{c}"
/>

where:

- &gamma;  = unit weight of the residual clay soil
- <em>h</em> = soil thickness above the void
- <em>c</em> = undrained cohesion

The critical dimensionless stability number for undrained (short-term) conditions as a function of <em>h</em>/<em>D</em> is portrayed as a stability
chart in <FigReference figKey="figure-22" /> and is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-18" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-18"
  equation="N_{c\phi,cr} = a(h/D)^{3} - b\left(\frac{h}{D}\right)^{2} + c\left(\frac{h}{D}\right) + d"
/>

where:

- <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> = constants (see Table 2)
- <em>h/D</em> = ratio of the thickness of the residual soil above the void at the rock surface to void diameter

To account for the inverted residual soil strength profile in the stability chart, <Citation citationKey="Drumm2009" /> also evaluated a weak zone of
 thickness 3<em>D</em>/4 overlying the rock surface with a reduced cohesion value (<em>c<sup>&#42;</sup></em>). The inverted strength factor (<em>&alpha;</em>)
relating to the two cohesion values is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-19" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-19"
  equation="\alpha = \frac{c^*}{c}"
/>

where:

- <em>c</em> = undrained cohesion for the soil above the weak zone
- <em>c*</em> = reduced cohesion for the soil in the weak zone

The values of the constants for undrained (short-term) conditions are shown in <TableReference tableKey="table-2" /> for values of <em>a</em> equal
to 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 and undrained angle of internal friction (&phi;) equal to zero. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated.

When <EquationNoRef equation = "N_{c\phi}"/> is greater than <EquationNoRef equation = "N_{c\phi,cr}"/>, the void is predicted to be unstable, and a sinkhole is likely to form. The factor of safety (<em>FS<sub>c&phi;</sub></em>) against undrained instability
is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-20" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-20"
  equation="FS_{c\phi} = \frac{N_{c\phi,cr}}{N_{c\phi}}"
/>

Input (in ascending order) up to seven different void diameters as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-24" />. If the void radius (<em>D</em>/2)
exceeds the embankment height (<em>H</em>) input in step 1, the void diameter cells have an orange background. Cells with FS less than 1 have
 an orange background. The critical thickness of residual soil to void diameter ratio (<em>h/D</em>)<em><sub>cr</sub></em> is linearly interpolated for
 a FS of 1. If possible, provide a sufficient range of void diameters to result in at least one computed FS greater than 1 and one less than 1, to
calculate (<em>h/D</em>)<em><sub>cr</sub></em>.

Solving <EquationReference equationKey="equation-16" /> for the void diameter (<em>D</em>) yields <EquationReference equationKey="equation-21" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-21"
  equation="D = \frac{H}{\frac{h}{D} + 0.5}"
/>

Substituting (<em>h/D</em>)<em><sub>cr</sub></em> for <em>h</em>/<em>D</em> in the denominator of <EquationReference equationKey="equation-21" />, the
 critical void diameter (<em>D<sub>cr</sub></em>) is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-22" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-22"
  equation="D_{cr} = \frac{H}{\left(\frac{h}{D}\right)_{cr}+0.5}"
/>

The volume of eroded soil prior to void collapse (<em>V</em>), assuming a spherical void, is calculated using
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-23" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-23"
  equation="V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3"
/>

The radius (<em>r</em>) in <EquationReference equationKey="equation-23" /> is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-24" />:

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-24"
  equation="r = \frac{D_{cr}}{2}"
/>

If the range of user-specified diameters of the void above the rock contact is not sufficient to interpolate a FS of 1, N/A is displayed for
(<em>h/D</em>)<em><sub>cr</sub></em>, <em>D<sub>cr</sub></em>, and <em>V</em>. The undrained (short-term) stability evaluation is illustrated in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-24" />.

## Drained Stability (Long-Term Conditions)

Step 3 assesses the stability of residual soils in karst, where subsurface voids may exist near the rock surface, under drained (long-term)
conditions. Input the effective cohesion (<em>c′</em>) and the effective angle of internal friction (<em>&phi;′</em>) of the residual clay soil as shown
in <FigReference figKey="figure-25" />.

The dimensionless stability number (<em>N<sub>c'&phi;'</sub></em>) for drained (long-term) conditions is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-25" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-25"
  equation="N_{c'\phi'} = \frac{\gamma h}{c'}"
/>

where:

- &gamma;  = unit weight of the residual clay soil
- <em> h </em> = soil thickness above the void
- <em>c′</em> = effective (drained) cohesion

The critical dimensionless stability number for drained (long-term) conditions as a function of <em>h</em>/<em>D</em> is portrayed as a stability
chart in <FigReference figKey="figure-22" /> and is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-26" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-26"
  equation="N_{c'\phi',cr} = a(h/D)^{3}-b\left(\frac{h}{D}\right)^{2} + c(h/D) +d"
/>

where:

- <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> = constants (see Table 3)
- <em>h/D</em> = ratio of the thickness of the residual soil above the void at the rock surface to void diameter

The values of the constants for drained (long-term) conditions are shown in <TableReference tableKey="table-3" /> for various values of effective
(drained) angle of internal angle (<em>&phi;'</em>). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated.

When <em>N<sub>c'&phi;'</sub></em> is greater than <em>N<sub>c'&phi;',cr</sub></em>, the void is predicted to be unstable, and a sinkhole is likely to form. The FS against drained instability (<em>FS<sub>c'&phi;'</sub></em>) is calculated
using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-27" />.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-27"
  equation="FS_{c'\phi'}=\frac{N_{c'\phi',cr}}{N_{c'\phi'}}"
/>

Input (in ascending order) up to seven different void diameters as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-25" />. If the void radius (<em>D</em>/2)
exceeds the embankment height (<em>H</em>) input in step 1, the void diameter cells have an orange background. Cells with FS less than 1 have
 an orange background. The critical thickness of residual soil to void diameter ratio (<em>h/D</em>)<em><sub>cr</sub></em> is linearly interpolated for
 a FS of 1. If possible, provide a sufficient range of void diameters to result in at least one computed FS greater than 1 and one less than 1, to
calculate (<em>h/D</em>)<em><sub>cr</sub></em>. The volume of eroded soil prior to void collapse (<em>V</em>) is calculated the same as in undrained
(short-term) conditions. The drained (long-term) stability evaluation is illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-25" />.

## Summary

In step 4, the stability numbers for undrained (short-term) conditions (blue circles) and drained (long-term) conditions (red circle) are plotted as a
 function of <em>h</em>/<em>D</em> at the bottom of the worksheet, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-26" />. Reference lines for the critical
stability number for undrained (short-term) conditions (blue line) and drained (long-term) conditions (red line) are also plotted as a function of
<em>h</em>/<em>D</em>. When a stability number plots above the reference line, the void is predicted to be unstable, and a sinkhole is likely to form.
 The light gray lines provide the critical stability numbers for the undrained and drained conditions modeled by <Citation citationKey="Drumm2009" />
 for reference.
