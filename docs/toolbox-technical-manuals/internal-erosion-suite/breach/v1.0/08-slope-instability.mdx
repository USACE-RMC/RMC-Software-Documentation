# Slope Instability

This worksheet does not assess the probability of breach by slope instability due to internal erosion. The recommended approach from Fell et al.
(2008) is to assess whether internal drainage measures in the dam or levee prevent pore pressures from rising in the embankment and/or its foundation
and use the estimated pore pressures to assess embankment stability using slope stability software.
