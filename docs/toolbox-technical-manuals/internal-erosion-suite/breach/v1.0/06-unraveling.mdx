# Unraveling

This worksheet evaluates the stable rock size for flow through a rockfill as a function of the unit discharge for a given downstream slope

At the beginning of the worksheet, input the slope cotangent, estimates of the unit discharge for each headwater level being considered, and the
median rock size. Input the minimum, most likely (mode), and maximum values for both the unit discharge through the rockfill and the median rock size.
 The mean estimate of the median rock side is calculated as the average of the minimum, most likely (mode), and maximum values. Although these values
represent a triangular distribution, a probabilistic analysis is not performed. Instead, the values are used to perform a sensitivity analysis. The
slope, unit discharge, and median rock size characterization input are illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-16" />.

## Solvik (1991) and Olivier (1967)

Option 1 evaluates the minimum stable rock size needed to withstand a given unit discharge through rockfill using
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-14" /> developed by <Citation citationKey="Solvik1991" /> based on sloping flume test results. It is
the same method presented in <Citation citationKey="Olivier1967" /> but converted to metric units.

:::danger Equation 14 Placeholder
Please replace the following component with your KaTeX-formatted equation:
<Equation
  equationKey="equation-14"
  equation="d_{s} = 1.46q_{t}^{0.66}S_{0}^0.78"
/>
:::

where:

- <em>d<sub>s</sub></em> = minimum stable rock size (m) for the rockfill, assumed to be the median rock size (<EquationNoRef equation = "d_50"/>)
- <em>q<sub>t</sub></em> = unit discharge through the rockfill (<EquationNoRef equation = "m^3"/>/s/m)
- <em>S<sub>o</sub></em> = downstream slope (measured as V/H)

The minimum stable rock size is calculated as a function of unit discharge and the downstream slope for the minimum, most likely (mode), maximum, and
mean unit discharges. The critical unit discharge is also calculated for the mean <em>d<sub>50</sub></em>, and the headwater elevation where that
critical unit discharge is first exceeded is linearly interpolated from the user-specified headwater-mean unit discharge relationship.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-17" /> illustrates the calculations for this option.

## EBL (2005) Method

Option 2 evaluates the minimum stable rock size needed to withstand a given unit discharge through rockfill using
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-15" /> from <Citation citationKey="EBL2005" /> based on model tests of flow through rockfill dams up
to 20 feet tall. The calculations are the same as in Option 1, except for the equation to calculate rock size. <FigReference figKey="figure-18" />
illustrates the calculations for this option.

:::danger Equation 15 Placeholder
Please replace the following component with your KaTeX-formatted equation:
<Equation
  equationKey="equation-15"
  equation="d_{50} = 0.43q_{t}^{0.43}S_{0}^{0.78}"
/>
:::

where:

- <em>d<sub>50</sub></em> = median rock size (m) needed for stability

## Summary

The mean unit discharge through the rockfill is plotted as a function of headwater level and mean value of <em>d<sub>50</sub></em> at the bottom of
the worksheet, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-19" />. Reference lines for the critical <em>d<sub>50</sub></em> (median rock size needed for
 stability) for <Citation citationKey="Solvik1991" /> and <Citation citationKey="Olivier1967" /> (black dashed line) and
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="EBL2005" /> (black solid line) are also plotted as a function of unit discharge through the rockfill. When a unit
discharge through the rockfill at a given headwater level plots right of a line of critical<em> d<sub>50</sub></em>, the rockfill is predicted to be
unstable. A blue box is also plotted showing the parameter limits for unit discharge through the rockfill and median rock size.

<FigReference figKey="figure-20" /> illustrates the plot options for this chart. The maximum values for the y-axis (median rock size) and x-axis (unit
 discharge) are user-specified.
