# Constricted Exit

Constricted, or non-erodible, exits consist of open joints, defects, or cracks in conduits, drains, walls, or rock. For erosion to continue, the opening size must be sufficient
for the adjacent base soil particles to pass through it. This worksheet assesses the joint/defect opening size that allows erosion to continue.

## Base Soil Characterization

Step 1 characterizes the base material. The range of _D<sub>95</sub>B_ of the base soil adjacent to the open joint, defect, or crack is obtained from the Base Gradation worksheet,
where the finest and coarsest _D<sub>95</sub>B_ of the adjacent base soil after regrading (if applicable) are interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear
scale for percent passing. <FigReference figKey="constricted-exit-base-soil" /> is an example of step 1.

/>

## Open Joint, Defect, or Crack Characterization

Step 2 characterizes the open joint, defect, or crack, and the joint/defect opening size (_JOS_) is input. The user-specified _JOS_ and range of _D<sub>95</sub>B_ of the adjacent
base soil are portrayed on a cumulative particle-size plot to visually compare their relative sizes, as shown in <FigReference figKey="effective-opening" />. The
y-axis (percent passing by weight) is truncated at 90 percent passing since only the particle-size diameter corresponding to 95 percent passing is used in the evaluation. The size
of the open joint, defect, or crack is depicted with a vertical back line at the _JOS_ and horizontal lines that extend infinitely smaller since a logarithmic scale is used. The
range of _D<sub>95</sub>B_ displays as a red horizontal line.

The plot options for this chart are illustrated in <FigReference figKey="plot-options" />. The minimum and maximum values for the x-axis (particle size) are user-specified.

## Likelihood of Continuation

Step 3 estimates the probability of continuing erosion (_P<sub>CE</sub>_) using the procedure of Fell and Foster <Citation citationKey="Toolbox2023" bibFile="/bibliographies/107_1_0-bib.json" />.
The _JOS_ that allows continuing erosion of the adjacent base soil (_JOS<sub>CE</sub>_) is between _D<sub>95</sub>B_ and _3D<sub>95</sub>B_. Sherard et al. <Citation citationKey="Sherard1984" bibFile="/bibliographies/107_1_0-bib.json" />
concluded that uniform filters act similar to laboratory sieves with an opening sieve size approximately equal to <Equation equationKey="p-ce-constricted" equation="\frac{D_{15}F}{9}" inline={true}/>.
The _D<sub>95</sub>B_ criterion assumes the Foster and Fell <Citation citationKey="FosterFell2001" bibFile="/bibliographies/107_1_0-bib.json" /> continuing erosion criterion (see section 8.4)
applies to erosion into an open joint, defect, or crack, and the crack width is equivalent to the filter opening size of the voids between the particles in a filter. The _3D<sub>95</sub>B_
criterion is based on the _JOS_ for cement grout to penetrate and flow along the opening of joints in rock.

The probabilities shown in <TableReference tableKey="constricted-exit-probabilities" /> considered these limits. In the table, _P<sub>CE</sub>_ is a function the ratio of
the _JOS_ to the finest _D<sub>95</sub>B_ of the adjacent base soil after regrading (if applicable). If <Equation equationKey="p-ce-constricted" equation="\frac{JOS}{D_{95}B}" inline={true}/>
is less than 0.4, zero is displayed. If <Equation equationKey="p-ce-constricted" equation="\frac{JOS}{D_{95}B}" inline={true}/> is greater than or equal to 0.4 and less
than 0.5, {'"<0.0001"'} is displayed. Intermediate values between 0.5 and 3.0 are interpolated using a z-variate scale for probability and a linear scale for the
ratio <Equation equationKey="p-ce-constricted" equation="\frac{JOS}{D_{95}B}" inline={true}/>.

According to Fell and Foster <Citation citationKey="Toolbox2023" bibFile="/bibliographies/107_1_0-bib.json" />, these probabilities apply to erosion into open defects in the foundation and conduits
or walls with steady flow conditions. Use higher probabilities for erosion into open defects in conduits or walls with dynamic flow conditions.

If the coarsest _D<sub>95</sub>B_ of the adjacent base soil after regrading is less than or equal to the _JOS_ (_coarsest_ _D<sub>95</sub>B_ ≤ _JOS_), the proportion of the _D<sub>95</sub>B_ finer
than the _JOS_ is 100 percent. If the finest _D<sub>95</sub>B_ of the adjacent base soil after regrading is greater than or equal to the _JOS_ (_finest_ _D<sub>95</sub>B_ ≥ _JOS_), the proportion
of the _D<sub>95</sub>B_ finer than the _JOS_ is 0 percent. If the coarsest _D<sub>95</sub>B_ of the adjacent base soil after regrading (if applicable) is greater than the _JOS_ and the
finest _D<sub>95</sub>B_ after regrading (if applicable) is less than the _JOS_, the proportion of the _D<sub>95</sub>B_ finer than the _JOS_ is calculated as in

<EquationReference equationKey="p-ce-constricted" />. <FigReference figKey="CE-probability" /> is an example of step 3.

<Equation equationKey="p-ce-constricted" equation="P_{CE} = \frac{log_{10}(JOS) - log_{10}(\textit{finest}\ D_{95}B)} {log_{10}(\textit{coarsest}\ D_{95}B) - log_{10}(\textit{finest}\ D_{95}B)}" />
