# Blanket Theory Case 5

Case 5 has a semi-pervious top stratum on only the riverside of the levee. The pervious substratum is divided into three zones to apply the method of
fragments as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-43" />. The difference between Cases 3 and 5 is that there is an impervious top stratum on the
riverside for Case 3 while the top stratum is semi-pervious for Case 5. Therefore, the effective seepage entry distance from the riverside levee toe
must be calculated based on the type of seepage entrance (riverside boundary condition).

## Method Analysis

The method of analysis is the same as in Case 1.

## Levee Geometry

Step 2 characterizes the levee geometry. The input includes the levee crest elevation, landside levee toe elevation, and base width of levee
(<em>L<sub>2</sub></em>). Use the drop-down list to select the riverside boundary condition using a drop-down list. The options for the type of
seepage entrance include:

- No riverside borrow pits or seepage blocks

- Riverside borrow pit (open seepage entrance) that penetrates the blanket and extends to the pervious substratum

- A seepage block (impervious boundary) between the riverside levee toe and the river that prevents any seepage entrance into the pervious foundation
  riverside of the seepage block

For “no riverside borrow pits or seepage blocks,” the input for <em>L<sub>1</sub></em> is the distance from the riverside levee toe to the river.
For “riverside borrow pit (open seepage entrance),” the input for <em>L<sub>1</sub></em> is the distance from the riverside levee toe to the borrow
pit. For “seepage block (impervious boundary),” the input for <em>L<sub>1</sub></em> is the distance from the riverside levee toe to the seepage
block. The input is illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-43" />.

## Pervious Substratum Characterization

The pervious stratum characterization is the same as in Case 1.

## Riverside Blanket (Top Stratum) Characterization

The selection in step 1 affects the input for step 4, and cells that do not apply have a gray background. These cells are not used in subsequent
calculations even if data is present. The input includes the transformed thickness (<em>z<sub>br</sub></em>) and transformed vertical permeability
(<em>k<sub>v</sub>,b<sub>r</sub></em>) of the riverside blanket.

Use the drop-down list to select the method of estimating the transformed vertical permeability of the riverside blanket. Input the transformed
vertical permeability directly or calculate it using an input permeability ratio (k<sub>h,f</sub>/k<sub>v</sub>,b<sub>r</sub>).

For deterministic analysis, input only the most likely values. The mean values used for subsequent calculations are the most likely (or mode) values.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-44" /> illustrates the deterministic input. <FigReference figKey="figure-45" /> illustrates the deterministic
input for permeability ratio as input.

For probabilistic analysis without using @RISK, input the minimum and maximum values in addition to the most likely value, and triangular
distributions represent the random variables. The mean values used in subsequent calculations are the average of the minimum, most likely, and maximum
values. <FigReference figKey="figure-46" /> illustrates the probabilistic input without using @RISK. <FigReference figKey="figure-47" />
illustrates the probabilistic input without using @RISK for permeability ratio as input.

For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, input the minimum, most likely, and maximum values of the random variables, and use an @RISK formula for a
triangular distribution in the third column as a default. Alternatively, input a valid @RISK distribution in lieu of this default formula, and the
user-specified input displays in the fourth column. The mean values used in subsequent calculations are the mean for the @RISK distribution entered in
the third column. <FigReference figKey="figure-48" /> illustrates the probabilistic input using @RISK. <FigReference figKey="figure-49" />
illustrates the probabilistic input without using @RISK for permeability ratio as input.

If no riverside seepage block (impervious boundary) exists, the effective seepage entry distance from the riverside levee toe (<em>x<sub>1</sub></em>)
is calculated using Equations 18 and 19.

<Equation equationKey="equation-18" equation="x_{1} = \frac{tanh(c_{br}L_{1})}{c_{br}}" />

where:

- <em>
    L<sub>1</sub>
  </em>
  = distance from the riverside levee toe to the river for the “no riverside borrow pits or seepage
  blocks” boundary condition or the distance from the riverside levee toe to the borrow pit for
  “riverside borrow pit (open seepage entrance)” boundary condition
- <em>
    c<sub>br</sub>
  </em>
  = constant for the riverside blanket

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-19"
  equation="c_{br} = \sqrt{ \frac{ k_{v,br} }{ k_{h,f} \\ z_{br} \\ d } }"
/>

where:

- <em>
    k<sub>h,f</sub>
  </em>
  = horizontal permeability of pervious substratum
- <em>d</em> = thickness of the pervious substratum
- <em>
    k<sub>v,br</sub>
  </em>
  = transformed vertical permeability of the riverside blanket (top substratum)
- <em>
    z<sub>br</sub>
  </em>
  = transformed thickness of the riverside blanket (top substratum)

If a seepage block exists between the riverside levee toe and the river that prevents any seepage entrance into the pervious foundation riverside of
the seepage block, the effective seepage entry distance from the riverside levee toe (<em>x<sub>1</sub></em>) is calculated using
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-20" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-20" equation="x_{1} = \frac{1}{c_{br}tanh(c_{br}L_1)}" />

where:

- <em>
    L<sub>1</sub>
  </em>
  = distance from the riverside levee toe to the seepage block for the “seepage block (impervious
  boundary)” boundary condition

The effective seepage length plus width of the levee is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-21" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-21" equation="S = x_{1} + L_2" />

where:

- <em>
    L<sub>2</sub>
  </em>
  = base width of the levee
- <em>
    x<sub>1</sub>
  </em>
  = effective seepage entry distance from the riverside levee toe for selected boundary condition

The riverside boundary condition selection in step 2 affects the equation for <em>x<sub>1</sub> </em>used in step 4, and cells that do not apply have
a gray background.

## Blanket Theory Assumptions

Step 5 checks the BT (method of fragments) assumptions against the input parameters to ensure essentially vertical equipotential lines, vertical flow
through the blanket and horizontal flow through the pervious foundation, and semi-pervious blanket behavior. For permeability ratios greater than
about 1,000 to 4,000, the semi-pervious blanket is effectively impervious, and Case 3 is more appropriate than Case 5. For deterministic analysis, the
assumptions are checked for the most likely values of the random variables. For probabilistic analysis, the assumptions are checked for the mean
values of the random variables. Values outside of the model assumptions have an orange background. <FigReference figKey="figure-50" /> illustrates
the check of BT assumptions.

  caption="Step 5 of BT Case 5 worksheet: BT assumptions."
/>

## Seepage Characterization

Step 6 calculates the net hydraulic head on the levee (<em>H</em>) the same as in Case 1. The flow or seepage per unit length of the levee
(<em>Q<sub>s</sub></em>) is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-22" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-22" equation="Q_{S} = k_{h,f}H\frac{d}{x_{1} + L_{2} + 0.43d}" />
where:

- <em>
    k<sub>h,f</sub>
  </em>
  = horizontal permeability of pervious substratum
- <em>H</em> = net hydraulic head on the levee
- <em>
    L<sub>2</sub>
  </em>
  = base width of the levee
- <em>d</em> = thickness of the pervious substratum
- <em>
    x<sub>1</sub>
  </em>
  = effective seepage entrance from the riverside levee toe

The format for the tabular output is the same as in Case 1.

## Likelihood of Heave/Blowout at Landside Toe

Since the excess hydraulic head at the landside levee toe is zero, vertical seepage exit gradients are not computed for this case.

## Likelihood of Heave/Blowout at Given Distance from Landside Toe

Since the excess hydraulic head at the landside levee toe and at any distance <em>x</em> from the landside levee toe are zero, vertical seepage exit
gradients at any distance <em>x</em> from the landside levee toe are not computed for this case.
