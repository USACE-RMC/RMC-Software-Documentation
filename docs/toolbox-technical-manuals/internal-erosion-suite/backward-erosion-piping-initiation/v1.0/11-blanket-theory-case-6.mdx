# Blanket Theory Case 6

Case 6 has a semi-pervious top stratum on only the landside of the levee. The pervious substratum is divided into three zones to apply the method of
fragments as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-51" />. The difference between Cases 4 and 6 is that there is an impervious top stratum on the
landside for Case 4 while the top stratum is semi-pervious for Case 6. Therefore, the effective seepage exit distance from the landside levee toe must
 be calculated based on the type of seepage exit (landside boundary condition).

## Method of Analysis

The method of analysis is the same as in Case 1.

## Levee Geometry

Step 2 characterizes the levee geometry. The input includes the levee crest elevation, landside levee toe elevation, and base width of levee
(<em>L<sub>2</sub></em>). Use the drop-down list to select the landside boundary condition. The options for the type of seepage exit include:

- A blanket extending infinitely landward

- An open seepage exit

- A seepage block (impervious boundary) beyond the landside levee toe that prevents any seepage exit into the pervious foundation landside of the
seepage block.

For “blanket extending infinitely landward,” no input is needed for <em>L<sub>3</sub></em> since it is infinitely long. For “open seepage exit,” the
input for <em>L<sub>3</sub></em> is the distance from the landside levee toe to the borrow pit. For “seepage block (impervious boundary),” the input
for <em>L<sub>3</sub></em> is the distance from the landside toe to the seepage block. The input is illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-51" />
.

## Pervious Substratum Characterization

The pervious stratum characterization is the same as in Case 1.

## Landside Blanket (Top Stratum) Characterization

The selection in step 1 affects the input for step 4, and cells that do not apply have a gray background. These cells are not used in subsequent
calculations even if data is present. The input includes the transformed thickness for effective seepage length (<em>z<sub>bl</sub></em>), effective
thickness for allowable uplift pressure (<em>z<sub>t</sub></em>), saturated unit weight of the landside blanket (<em>g<sub>sat</sub></em>), and
transformed vertical permeability of the landside blanket (<em>k<sub>v,bl</sub></em>).

:::
Use the drop-down list to select the method of estimating the transformed vertical permeability of the landside blanket. Input the transformed
vertical permeability directly or calculate it using an input permeability ratio (<em>k<sub>h,f</sub>k<sub>v,bl</sub></em>).

For a deterministic analysis, input only the most likely values. The mean values used for subsequent calculations are the most likely (or mode)
values. <FigReference figKey="figure-52" /> illustrates the deterministic input. <FigReference figKey="figure-53" /> illustrates the deterministic
input for permeability ratio as input.

For probabilistic analysis without using @RISK, input the minimum and maximum values in addition to the most likely value, and triangular
distributions represent the random variables. The mean values used in subsequent calculations are the average of the minimum, most likely, and maximum
 values. <FigReference figKey="figure-54" /> illustrates the probabilistic input without using @RISK. <FigReference figKey="figure-55" />
illustrates the probabilistic input without using @RISK for permeability ratio as input.

For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, input the minimum, most likely, and maximum values of the random variables, and use an @RISK formula for a
triangular distribution in the third column as a default. Alternatively, input a valid @RISK distribution in lieu of this default formula, and the
user-specified input displays in the fourth column. The mean values used in subsequent calculations are the mean for the @RISK distribution entered in
 the third column. <FigReference figKey="figure-56" /> illustrates the probabilistic input using @RISK. <FigReference figKey="figure-57" />
illustrates the probabilistic input without using @RISK for permeability ratio as input.

The thicknesses <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> and <em>z<sub>t</sub></em> are positively correlated. For probabilistic analysis, values for the distributions
 for <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> and <em>z<sub>t</sub></em> must be sampled in the same direction. If a high value of <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> is sampled,
a high value of <em>z<sub>t</sub></em> must be sampled; if a low value of <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> is sampled, a low value of <em>z<sub>t</sub></em>
must be sampled. For probabilistic analysis without using @RISK, this correlation is accounted for by sampling the same percentile from each
distribution. For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, the correlation matrix named “zCorr” defined on the BT Transformation worksheet must be added to
 the end of the user-specified input distributions for <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> and <em>z<sub>t</sub></em> using the @RISK RiskCorrmat property
function. Use RiskCorrmat(zCorr,1) for <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> and RiskCorrmat(zCorr,2) for <em>z<sub>t</sub></em>. For example, the triangular input
distributions of RiskTriang(F60,G60,H60) for <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> and RiskTriang(F61,G61,H61) for <em>z<sub>t</sub></em> become
RiskTriang(F60,G60,H60,RiskCorrmat(zCorr,1)) and RiskTriang(F61,G61,H61,RiskCorrmat(zCorr,2)), respectively.

For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, if more than one of the BT Case 6, BT Case 7, and BT Case 8 worksheets exist in the active workbook, @RISK returns
 a warning message when the simulate button in the @RISK ribbon is selected as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-58" />. (The workbook name in
brackets matches the user’s active workbook name.) Select “Yes” to continue the simulation because the same correlation matrix (named range of “zCorr”
 on the BT Transformation worksheet) is used for the input distributions for <em>z<sub>bl</sub></em> and <em>z<sub>t</sub></em> on the BT Case 6, BT
Case 7, and BT Case 8 worksheets.

If the blanket extends infinitely landward, the effective seepage exit distance from the landside levee toe (<em>x<sub>3</sub></em>) is calculated
using Equations 23 and 24.

block, the effective seepage exit distance from the landside levee toe (<em>x<sub>3</sub></em>) is calculated using

## Blanket Theory Assumptions

:::danger Inline Equation Detected
Insert `<EquationNoRef />` component(s) to render math in the following paragraph.
:::
Step 5 checks the BT (method of fragments) assumptions against the input parameters to ensure essentially vertical equipotential lines, vertical flow
through the blanket and horizontal flow through the pervious foundation, and semi-pervious blanket behavior. For permeability ratios greater than
about 1,000 to 4,000, the semi-pervious blanket is effectively impervious, and Case 4 is more appropriate than Case 6. For deterministic analysis, the
 assumptions are checked for the most likely values of the random variables. For probabilistic analysis, the assumptions are checked for the mean
values of the random variables. Values outside of the model assumptions have an orange background. For a blanket extending infinitely landward
(<em>L<sub>3</sub></em> = <em>∞</em>), (<em>L<sub>2</sub></em> + <em>x<sub>3</sub></em>)<em>d</em> = <em>∞</em> for all values of <em>d</em>.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-59" /> illustrates the check of BT assumptions.

(<em>h<sub>x</sub></em>) using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-30" />.
