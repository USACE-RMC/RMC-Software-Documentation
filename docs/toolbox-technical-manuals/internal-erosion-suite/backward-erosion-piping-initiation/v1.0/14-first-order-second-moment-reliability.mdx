# First-Order, Second-Moment Reliability

The Taylor series is a method to estimate the expected value (mean) and standard deviation of a limit state, given the means and standard deviations
of the parameters. This method is termed a first-order, second-moment (FOSM) method, as only first-order (linear) terms of the series are retained and
 only the first two moments (mean and the standard deviation) are considered. The Taylor series method of reliability analysis has been used by USACE
for many years to compute the reliability index and probability of unsatisfactory performance.

Only the first two moments (mean and variance) represent the probability density function in the reliability analysis, and all higher order terms are
neglected in the Taylor series expansion used to estimate the mean and variance of the natural logarithm of the factor of safety. When using the
reliability index method, no knowledge is needed of the exact probability density function that represents random variable.

<FigReference figKey="figure-69" /> shows the seepage analysis run cases for a single headwater level of interest after estimating the mean and
standard deviation of each random variable (RV). The first run case uses the mean (<em></em>) of all random variables to obtain the mean value of the
 vertical seepage exit gradient (<em>i<sub>v</sub></em>). In subsequent run cases, each random variable is adjusted up or down by its standard
deviation (<em></em>) while using the mean values of all other random variables. The vertical seepage exit gradient is from seepage analysis for the various
 permutations. Run Cases 10 and 11 involve the saturated unit weight of the landside blanket, which is used to calculate the critical vertical seepage
 exit gradient for heave/blowout. Since no changes to the seepage model are required for these two run cases, the mean vertical seepage exit gradient from
 Run Case 1 is used. After obtaining the vertical seepage exit gradient for Run Cases 1 to 9, the factor of safety against heave/blowout (based on
vertical seepage gradients) is calculated for all eleven run cases.

The mean and standard deviation of the natural logarithm of the factor of safety are obtained using the mean, standard deviation, and correlation
coefficients of the random variables in the Taylor series method.

Up to five random variables and seven headwater levels for the seepage analysis can be input. For five random variables, a total of eleven seepage
analyses are required for each headwater level. If seven headwater levels are assessed with five random variables, a total of seventy-seven seepage
analyses are required. Thus, the number of seepage analysis model runs is a function of the number of random variables and headwater levels, and the
Taylor series method is very labor intensive. Usually, only a few random variables control the seepage analysis. Select only those random variables
that are expected to significantly drive the results to reduce unnecessary computational effort that does not significantly improve the precision of
the results.

## Foundation Characterization

Step 1 characterizes the foundation. The input includes the saturated unit weight of the landside top stratum (<em><sub>sat</sub></em>) and up to
four additional random variables (e.g., thickness of top stratum, horizontal permeability of pervious foundation, permeability ratio, etc.). Normal
distributions represent the random variables, and the mean (<em></em>) and standard deviation (<em></em>) are input.

The 3-sigma rule is based on the normal distribution probability density function, where the lowest conceivable value is about three standard
deviations (3 sigma) below the mean, and the highest conceivable value is about three standard deviations above the mean. For the mean plus or minus
three standard deviations (<em></em> ± 3<em></em>), 99.73 percent of the area under the normal distribution is included. Therefore, 99.73 percent of
 all possible values of the random variable are included in the range of 6<em></em> (the highest possible value to the lowest possible value of the
random variable). Thus, the standard deviation using the 3-sigma rule using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-41" />.

where:

- HCV = the highest conceivable value of the random variable
- LCV = the lowest conceivable value of the random variable

Use the drop-down list to select whether to use the 3-sigman rule to calculate the standard deviation of the random variables. For “Yes,” input the
lowest conceivable value (LCV) and highest conceivable value (HCV). Although the standard deviation is calculated using the 3-sigma rule, it informs
the user-specified value in the subsequent row, which is used in the calculations. For “No,” the standard deviation of the random variables is
user-specified. Cells that do not apply have a gray background. These cells are not used in subsequent calculations even if data is present. The two
possible scenarios are illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-70" /> and <FigReference figKey="figure-71" />.

<em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em> represents an upper bound for an intact blanket (top stratum), and initiation occurs at significantly lower values in many
cases through defects in the blanket (such as the data from Turnbull and Mansur for the lower Mississippi River).

The variance of the factor of safety against heave/blowout (<em>Var</em>[<em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em>]) is calculated using

The Var[<em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em>] for each random variable divided by the sum of all the variances gives the percentage that random variable affects
the analysis. Thus, the random variable(s) that control(s) the reliability analysis can easily be determined based on the higher percentages. The
relative contribution to the analysis is shown as a percentage beneath the Var[<em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em>] for each random variable.

The standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the <em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em> are calculated using Equations 45 and 46.

Physical quantities that result from a summation of many independent processes have distributions that are approximately normal. Physical quantities
resulting from a product of many independent processes have distributions that are approximately lognormal. Lognormal distributions are used with
reliability analyses. The probability density function of a factor of safety can be represented by a lognormal probability density function.

In <FigReference figKey="figure-72" />, the hatched area under the curve and to left of a FS of 1 gives the probability of a FS less than 1,
P(<em>FS</em> < 1), often referred to as the probability of unsatisfactory performance, P(<em>u</em>), in reliability analysis. When the lognormal
distribution is transformed to a normal distribution by taking the natural logarithm of the factor of safety, ln(1) = 0. Thus, P(<em>FS</em> < 1) is
represented by the hatched area under the normal distribution curve to the left of zero in <FigReference figKey="figure-73" />.

Lognormal is favorable for FS for several reasons. First, a lognormal function is never negative, and the FS is never negative. Second, the product of
 several variables is lognormally distributed.

The reliability index (<em>β</em>) is a measure of the distance that the mean of the FS is away from 1 or unsatisfactory performance. The larger the
value of <em>β</em>, the more reliable the structure is for the performance mode being assessed (for example, seepage or stability). The smaller the
value of <em>β</em>, the closer the condition is to unsatisfactory performance. The reliability index (<em>b</em>) is calculated using Equation 47.

For each headwater level evaluated in the seepage analysis, the probability of a factor of safety against heave/blowout less than 1,
P(<em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em> < 1), is calculated as shown in the example in <FigReference figKey="figure-74" />. The headwater input for these tables
must be the headwater used in the seepage analysis, which can differ from the headwater levels input at the top of the worksheet. Do not include the
headwater level where <em>i<sub>v</sub></em> = 0 in step 2 to avoid unexpected interpolation errors in step 3.

## Likelihood of Heave/Blowout at Landside Toe

Step 3 interpolates the mean factor of safety against heave/blowout (based on vertical seepage gradients) and the probability of a factor of safety
less than 1 from the results of the seepage analysis for the headwater levels input at the top of the worksheet. The mean <em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em>
values are linearly interpolated, and the P(<em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em> < 1) is interpolated using logarithmic scale for probability and linear scale for
 headwater as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-76" />.
