# Blanket Theory Case 2

Case 2 has an impervious top stratum on both the riverside and landside of the levee. The pervious substratum is divided into three zones to apply the
method of fragments as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-22" />.

## Method of Analysis

The method of analysis is the same as in [Case 1](06-blanket-theory-case-1.mdx).

## Levee Geometry

Step 2 characterizes the levee geometry. The input includes the levee crest elevation, landside toe elevation, distance from the riverside levee toe
to the river (_L<sub>1</sub>_), base width of the levee (_L<sub>2</sub>_), and length of the foundation and top stratum beyond the
landside levee toe (_L<sub>3</sub>_), as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-22" />.

  caption="Step 2 of BT Case 2 worksheet: Levee geometry."
/>

## Pervious Substratum Characterization

The pervious stratum characterization is the same as in Case 1.

## Landside Blanket (Top Stratum) Characterization

Step 4 characterizes the landside (top stratum). The selections in step 1 affect the input for step 4, and cells that do not apply have a gray
background. These cells are not used in subsequent calculations even if data is present. The input includes thickness (_z<sub>bl</sub>_) and
saturated unit weight (_&gamma;<sub>sat</sub>_) of the landside blanket. For deterministic analysis, input only the most likely values. The mean
values used for subsequent calculations are the most likely (or mode) values.

The critical vertical seepage exit gradient for heave/blowout (_i<sub>cv</sub>_), as defined in Terzaghi, Peck, and Mesri (1996), is calculated
using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-6" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-6" equation="i_{cv} = \frac{\gamma '}{\gamma_{w}} = \frac{\gamma_{sat}-\gamma_{w}}{\gamma_{w}}" />

where:

> &gamma;' = submerged unit weight of the landside blanket  
> &gamma;<sub>sat</sub> = saturated unit weight of the landside blanket  
> &gamma;<sub>w</sub> = unit weight of water

<FigReference figKey="figure-23" /> illustrates the deterministic input.

  alt="Step 4 of BT Case 2 worksheet: Deterministic input."
  caption="Step 4 of BT Case 2 worksheet: Deterministic input."
/>

For probabilistic analysis without using @RISK, input the minimum and maximum values in addition to the most likely value, and triangular
distributions represent the random variables. The mean values used in subsequent calculations are the average of the minimum, most likely, and maximum
values. The triangular distribution for _i<sub>cv</sub>_ is calculated using the minimum, most likely, and maximum values for _&gamma;<sub>sat</sub>_.
Since _i<sub>cv</sub>_ is a function of the random variable _&gamma;<sub>sat</sub>_, it is correlated with _&gamma;<sub>sat</sub>_, and is also a random
variable. <FigReference figKey="figure-24" /> is an example of the probabilistic input without using @RISK.

<Figure

  alt="Step 4 of BT Case 2 worksheet: Probabilistic input without using @RISK."
  caption="Step 4 of BT Case 2 worksheet: Probabilistic input without using @RISK."
/>

For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, input the minimum, most likely, and maximum values, and use an @RISK formula for a triangular distribution in
the third column as a default. Alternatively, input a valid @RISK distribution in lieu of this default formula, and the user-specified input displays
in the fourth column. The mean values used for subsequent calculations are the mean for the @RISK distribution in the third column.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-25" /> illustrates the probabilistic input using @RISK.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-25"

  alt="Step 4 of BT Case 2 worksheet: Probabilistic input using @RISK."
  caption="Step 4 of BT Case 2 worksheet: Probabilistic input using @RISK."
/>

If using @RISK to perform probabilistic analysis, delete unnecessary calculation worksheets because the simulation is performed for all worksheets in
the workbook, and this is time consuming. If cycling through iterations using @RISK, the displayed results are no longer mean values of the random variables;
they are the selected iteration’s values.

## Blanket Theory Assumptions

Step 5 checks the BT (method of fragments) assumptions against the input parameters to ensure essentially vertical equipotential lines. For
deterministic analysis, the assumptions are checked for the most likely values of the random variables. For probabilistic analysis, the assumptions
are checked for the mean values of the random variables. Values outside of the model assumptions have an orange background.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-26" /> illustrates the check of BT assumptions.

## Seepage Characterization

Step 6 calculates the net hydraulic head on the levee (_H_) is calculated the same as in [Case 1](06-blanket-theory-case-1.mdx). The flow or
seepage per unit length of the levee (_Q<sub>S</sub>_) is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-7" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-7" equation="Q_{S} = k_{h,f}H\frac{d}{L_{1}+L_{2}+L_{3}}" />

where:

> _k<sub>h,f</sub>_ = horizontal permeability of the pervious substratum  
> _H_ = net hydraulic head on the levee  
> _L<sub>1</sub>_ = distance from the riverside levee toe to the river  
> _L<sub>2</sub>_ = base width of the levee  
> _L<sub>3</sub>_ = length of the foundation and top stratum beyond the landside levee toe  
> _d_ = thickness of the pervious substratum

The format for the tabular output is the same as in [Case 1](06-blanket-theory-case-1.mdx).

## Likelihood of Heave/Blowout at Landside Toe

Step 7 calculates the excess hydraulic head at the landside levee toe (_h<sub>o</sub>_) using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-8" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-8" equation="h_{o} = H\frac{L_{3}}{L_{1}+L_{2}+L_{3}}" />

where:

> _H_ = net hydraulic head on the levee  
> _L<sub>1</sub>_ = distance from riverside levee toe to the river  
> _L<sub>2</sub>_ = base width of the levee  
> _L<sub>3</sub>_ = length of the foundation and top stratum beyond the landside levee toe

The vertical seepage exit gradient at the landside levee toe (_i<sub>v</sub>_) is calculated using
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-9" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-9" equation="i_{v} = \frac{h_o}{z_{bl}}" />

where:

> _h<sub>o</sub>_ = excess hydraulic head at the landside levee toe  
> _z<sub>bl</sub>_ = thickness of the landside blanket (top stratum)

The factor of safety against heave/blowout (based on vertical seepage gradients) at the landside levee toe (_FS<sub>vg</sub>_) is calculated
using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-10" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-10" equation="FS_{vg} = \frac{i_{cv}}{i_v}" />

where:

> _i<sub>cv</sub>_ = critical vertical seepage exit gradient for heave/blowout  
> _i<sub>v</sub>_ = vertical seepage exit gradient at the landside levee toe

For deterministic analysis, _FS<sub>vg</sub>_ is calculated for each headwater level using the most likely values of the random variables and
is summarized in a table. Cells that do not apply have a gray background. For probabilistic analysis, _FS<sub>vg</sub>_ is calculated as
described for the deterministic analysis but for the mean values of the random variables, and multiple iterations are performed by sampling the
distributions in steps 3 and 4. The probability of heave/blowout is equal to the percentage of iterations that resulted in a _FS<sub>vg</sub>_
less than 1 [P(_FS<sub>vg</sub>_ < 1)]. For probabilistic analysis performed without using @RISK, 1,000 iterations are used. For probabilistic
analysis using @RISK, the number of iterations is user-specified, and “@RISK” displays in parentheses after the number of iterations for this
scenario. If cycling through iterations using @RISK, the displayed results are no longer mean values; they are the selected iteration’s values. For
deterministic and probabilistic analyses, cells with _FS<sub>vg</sub>_ less than 1 have an orange background.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-27" /> illustrates the deterministic tabular output, and <FigReference figKey="figure-28" /> illustrates the
probabilistic tabular output without using @RISK.

At the end of step 7, summary plots are generated. The first plot is the mean FS against heave/blowout (red solid line) and vertical seepage exit
gradient at the landside levee toe (green solid line) as functions of headwater level. _FS<sub>vg</sub>_ is plotted on the primary y-axis, and
_i<sub>v</sub>_ is plotted on the secondary y-axis. Horizontal reference lines display for the mean critical vertical seepage exit gradient (green
dashed line) and _FS<sub>vg</sub>_ of 1 (red dashed line). If cycling through iterations using @RISK, the displayed results are no longer mean
values; they are the selected iteration. <FigReference figKey="figure-29" /> illustrates the deterministic graphical output.

<FigReference figKey="figure-30" /> illustrates the plot options for this chart. The maximum value for the primary y-axis (_FS<sub>vg</sub>_), maximum
value for the secondary y-axis (_i<sub>v</sub>_), and minimum and maximum values for the x-axis (headwater level) are user-specified. The five
vertical reference elevations displayed at the top of the chart correspond to 25-percent increments of the levee height (levee crest elevation minus
levee landside toe elevation) and cannot be changed.

For probabilistic analysis, the mean probability of heave/blowout at the landside levee toe is plotted as a function of headwater level. If cycling
through iterations using @RISK, this plot has a gray background because the probability of initiation cannot be calculated from a single iteration.
Similarly, this plot has a gray background for deterministic analysis. <FigReference figKey="figure-31" /> illustrates the graphical output for
probabilistic analysis.

<FigReference figKey="figure-32" /> illustrates the plot options for this chart. The vertical reference elevations and minimum and maximum values for
the x-axis (headwater level) are the same as the previous chart. Only the maximum value for the y-axis (probability of heave/blowout) is
user-specified.

## Likelihood of Heave/Blowout at Given Distance from Landside Toe

Step 8 calculates the excess hydraulic head at a distance x from the landside levee toe (_h<sub>x</sub>_) using
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-11" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-11" equation="h_{x} = h_{o}\frac{L_{3}-x}{L_3}" />

where:

> _h<sub>o</sub>_ = excess hydraulic head at the landside levee toe  
> _L<sub>3</sub>_ = length of the foundation and top stratum beyond the landside levee toe  
> _x_ = distance from the landside levee toe

The vertical seepage exit gradient at a distance _x_ from the landside levee toe (_i<sub>v,x</sub>_) is calculated using
Equation 12.

<Equation equationKey="equation-12" equation="i_{v,x} = \frac{h_x}{z_{bl}}" />

where:

> _h<sub>x</sub>_ = excess hydraulic head at a distance x from the landside levee toe  
> _z<sub>bl</sub>_ = thickness of the landside blanket (top stratum)

The factor of safety against heave/blowout (based on vertical seepage gradients) at a distance _x_ from the landside levee toe
(_FS<sub>vg,x</sub>_) is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-13" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-13" equation="FS_{vg,x} = \frac{i_{cv}}{i_{v,x}}" />

where:

> _i<sub>cv</sub>_ = critical vertical seepage exit gradient for heave/blowout  
> _i<sub>v,x</sub>_ = vertical seepage exit gradient at a distance x from the landside levee toe

For deterministic analysis, _FS<sub>vg</sub><sub>,x</sub>_ is calculated for each headwater level using the most likely values of the random variables
and is summarized in a table. Cells that do not apply have a gray background. For probabilistic analysis, _FS<sub>vg,x</sub>_ is calculated as
described for the deterministic analysis but for the mean values of the random variables, and multiple iterations are performed by sampling the
distributions in steps 3 and 4. The probability of heave/blowout at a distance _x_ from the landside levee is equal to the percentage of
iterations that resulted in a _FS<sub>vg</sub><sub>,x</sub>_ less than 1 [P(_FS<sub>vg</sub><sub>,x</sub>_ < 1)]. For probabilistic
analysis performed without using @RISK, 1,000 iterations are used. For probabilistic analysis using @RISK, the number of iterations is user-specified,
and “@RISK” displays in parentheses after the number of iterations for this scenario. If cycling through iterations using @RISK, the displayed
results are no longer mean values; they are the selected iteration’s values. For deterministic and probabilistic analyses, cells with _FS<sub>vg,x</sub>_
less than 1 have an orange background. <FigReference figKey="figure-33" /> illustrates the deterministic tabular output, and <FigReference figKey="figure-34" />
illustrates the probabilistic tabular output without using @RISK.

At the end of Step 8, summary plots are generated after the tabular output. The first plot is the mean FS against heave/blowout at a distance _x_ from the
landside levee (red solid line) and vertical seepage exit gradient at a distance _x_ from the landside levee toe (green solid line) as functions of headwater
level. _FS<sub>vg,x</sub>_ is plotted on the primary y-axis, and _i<sub>v,x</sub>_ is plotted on the secondary y-axis. Horizontal reference lines display
for the mean critical vertical seepage exit gradient (green dashed line) and _FS<sub>vg,x</sub>_ of 1 (red dashed line). If cycling through iterations
