# Blanket Theory Case 7

Case 7 has a semi-pervious top stratum on both the riverside and landside of the levee. The pervious substratum is divided into three zones to apply
the method of fragments as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-63" />. The difference between Cases 2 and 7 is that there is an impervious top
stratum on both the riverside and landside of the levee for Case 2, while the top strata are semi-pervious for Case 7. Therefore, the effective
seepage entry distance from the riverside levee toe must be calculated based on the type of seepage entrance (riverside boundary condition), and the
effective seepage exit distance from the landside levee toe must be calculated based on the type of seepage exit (landside boundary condition).

## Method of Analysis

The method of analysis is the same as in Case 1.

## Levee Geometry

Step 2 characterizes the levee geometry. The input includes the levee crest elevation, landside levee toe elevation, and base width of levee
(<em>L<sub>2</sub></em>). Use the drop-down lust to select the riverside boundary condition. The options for the type of seepage entrance include:

- No riverside borrow pits or seepage blocks

- Riverside borrow pit (open seepage entrance) that penetrates the blanket and extends to the pervious substratum

- A seepage block (impervious boundary) between the riverside levee toe and the river that prevents any seepage entrance into the pervious foundation
  riverside of the seepage block

For “no riverside borrow pits or seepage blocks,” the input for <em>L<sub>1</sub></em> is the distance from the riverside levee toe to the river. For
“riverside borrow pit (open seepage entrance),” the input for <em>L<sub>1</sub></em> is the distance from the riverside levee toe to the borrow pit.
For “seepage block (impervious boundary),” the input for <em>L<sub>1</sub></em> is the distance from the riverside levee toe to the seepage block.

Use the drop-down list to select the landside boundary condition. The options for the type of seepage exit include:

- A blanket extending infinitely landward as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-60" /> (Case 7a)

- An open seepage exit as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-61" /> (Case 7b)

- A seepage block (impervious boundary) beyond the landside levee toe that prevents any seepage exit into the pervious foundation landside of the
  seepage block as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-62" /> (Case 7c)

For “blanket extending infinitely landward,” no input is needed for <em>L<sub>3</sub></em> since it is infinitely long. For “open seepage exit,” the
input for <em>L<sub>3</sub></em> is the distance from the landside levee toe to the borrow pit. For “seepage block (impervious boundary),” the input
for <em>L<sub>3</sub></em> is the distance from the landside toe to the seepage block. The input is illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-63" />
.

## Pervious Substratum Characterization

The pervious stratum characterization is the same as in Case 1.

## Riverside Blanket (Top Stratum) Characterization

The riverside blanket (top stratum) characterization is the same as in Case 5.

## Landside Blanket (Top Stratum) Characterization

The landside blanket (top stratum) characterization is the same as in Case 6.

## Blanket Theory Assumptions

Step 6 checks the BT (method of fragments) assumptions against the input parameters to ensure essentially vertical equipotential lines, vertical flow
through the blanket and horizontal flow through the pervious foundation, and semi-pervious blanket behavior. For permeability ratios greater than
about 1,000 to 4,000, the semi-pervious blankets are effectively impervious, and Case 2 is more appropriate than Case 7. For deterministic analysis,
the assumptions are checked for the most likely values of the random variables. For probabilistic analysis, the assumptions are checked for the mean
values of the random variables. Values outside of the model assumptions have an orange background. For a blanket extending infinitely landward
(<em>L<sub>3</sub></em> = <em>∞</em>), (<em>x<sub>1</sub></em> + <em>L<sub>2</sub></em> + <em>x<sub>3</sub></em>) / <em>d</em> = <em>∞</em> for all
values of <em>d</em>. <FigReference figKey="figure-64" /> illustrates the check of BT assumptions.

## Seepage Characterization

Step 7 calculates the net hydraulic head on the levee (<em>H</em>) the same as in Case 1. The flow or seepage per unit length of the levee
(<em>Q<sub>s</sub></em>) is calculated using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-34" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-34" equation="Q_{S} = k_{h,f}H\frac{d}{x_{1}+L_{2}+x_{3}}" />

where:

- <em>
    k<sub>h,f</sub>
  </em>
  = horizontal permeability of pervious substratum
- <em>H</em> = net hydraulic head on the levee
- <em>
    L<sub>2</sub>
  </em>
  = base width of the levee
- <em>d</em> = thickness of the pervious substratum
- <em>
    x<sub>1</sub>
  </em>
  = effective seepage entrance from the riverside levee toe
- <em>
    x<sub>3</sub>
  </em>
  = effective seepage exit from the landside levee toe

The format for the tabular output is the same as in Case 1.

## Likelihood of Heave/Blowout at Landside Toe

Step 8 calculates the excess hydraulic head at the landside levee toe (<em>h<sub>o</sub></em>) using <EquationReference equationKey="equation-35" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-35" equation="h_{o} = H\frac{x_3}{x_{1}+L_{2}+x_3}" />

where:

- <em>H</em> = net hydraulic head on the levee
- <em>
    L<sub>2</sub>
  </em>
  = base width of the levee
- <em>d</em> = thickness of the pervious substratum
- <em>
    x<sub>1</sub>
  </em>
  = effective seepage entrance from the riverside levee toe
- <em>
    x<sub>3</sub>
  </em>
  = effective seepage exit from the landside levee toe

The vertical seepage exit gradient at the landside levee toe (<em>i<sub>v</sub></em>) is calculated the same as in Case 6, and the factor of safety
against heave/blowout (based on vertical seepage gradients) at the landside levee toe (<em>FS<sub>vg</sub></em>) is calculated the same as in Case 2.
The format for the tabular and graphical output is the same as in Case 2.

## Likelihood of Heave/Blowout at Given Distance from Landside Toe

The vertical seepage exit gradient at a distance x from the landside levee toe (<em>i<sub>v</sub><sub>,x</sub></em>) is calculated the same as in Case
6, and the factor of safety against heave/blowout (based on vertical seepage gradients) at a distance x from the landside levee toe
(<em>FS<sub>vg,x</sub></em>) is calculated the same as in Case 2. The format for the tabular and graphical output is the same as in Case 2.
