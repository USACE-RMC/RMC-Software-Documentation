# Background

Soil contact erosion is defined as the selective erosion of fine particles from the contact with a coarser layer caused by flow passing through the
coarser layer parallel to the contact. It is a scour mechanism like concentrated leak erosion through a crack, but the flow is through a coarse soil
layer scouring finer materials in contact with the coarse layer. The field conditions necessary for soil contact erosion are uncommonâ€”the cases that
led to lab testing this process apparently were a result of silt levees placed on open-work gravels resulting in sinkholes or subsidence. Generally,
soil contact erosion is not likely to lead to breach and is considered a contributing mechanism (e.g., can lead to internal migration and sinkhole
development or form a roof/pipe for concentrated leak erosion).

The domain for evaluating initiation of soil contact erosion is defined by a geometric condition and a hydraulic condition. The geometric condition
requires that the pores of the coarse soil layer be sufficiently large to allow fine soil particles to pass through, while the hydraulic condition
requires that the flow velocity through the coarser layer be sufficient to detach the fine soil particles and transport them.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-8" /> and <TableReference tableKey="table-3" />, adapted from <Citation citationKey="Brauns1985" /> in
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Robbins2018" />, illustrates the influence of geometry and hydraulic conditions on the critical Froude number for
erosion. In this figure, D<sub>15</sub>F is the particle-size diameter of the filter material (coarse or gravel layer) corresponding to 15 percent
passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve, and D<sub>85</sub>B is the particle-size diameter of the base material (fine layer)
corresponding to 85 percent passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve.

In general, soils with D<sub>15</sub>F/D<sub>85</sub>B ratios less than about 7.5 to 8 do not meet the geometric condition and are not susceptible to
soil contact erosion. If the geometric condition is met, the critical Darcy velocity of the flow through the filter (coarse layer) at which erosion of
the fine base soil is expected must be estimated. A transition zone exists as D<sub>15</sub>F/D<sub>85</sub>B approaches the geometric condition in
which the critical Darcy velocity depends on both geometric and hydraulic conditions.

Once D<sub>15</sub>F/D<sub>85</sub>B becomes greater than about 25 to 30, purely hydraulic conditions control the erosion, and the critical Darcy
velocity must be estimated from the method of either <Citation citationKey="Guidoux2010" /> for sand, silt, and sand/clay mixtures below gravel or
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Brauns1985" /> for sand below gravel as shown below for porosities of the gravel layer of 0.25 and 0.40. Most of the
testing was performed on gravel with a porosity of about 0.40. In <FigReference figKey="figure-9" />, the <Citation citationKey="Brauns1985" />
relationship is equivalent to <Citation citationKey="Guidoux2010" /> within the range of applicability.

Applying these methods correctly requires understanding the context from which each method was developed, as the laboratory test conditions may vary
from field conditions. For example, the <Citation citationKey="Guidoux2010" /> and <Citation citationKey="Brauns1985" /> methods apply to gravel
below fine soil. Experimental data with fine soil above gravel is limited. This phenomenon is complex and cannot be linked to riverine erosion.
Influence of confining stress on critical Darcy velocity existed. Although measured critical Darcy velocities were of similar order of magnitude as
gravel above fine soil (i.e., between 1 and 10 cm/s), the critical Darcy velocity can be much lower. For silt above gravel where erosion might be
expected to initiate when silt particles fall into the gravel, initiation of soil contact erosion depends on the transport of particles, not by
detachment. Therefore, neither method applies.
