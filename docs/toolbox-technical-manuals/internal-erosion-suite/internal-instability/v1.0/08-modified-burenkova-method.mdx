# Modified Burenkova Method

The Burenkova method <Citation citationKey="Burenkova1993" /> characterized the heterogeneity of cohesionless sand-gravel soils using two conditional factors
of uniformity: <em>h′</em> and <em>h″</em>, where <em>D</em><sub>90</sub>, <em>D</em><sub>60</sub>, and <em>D</em><sub>15</sub> are the particle sizes
corresponding to 90, 60, and 15 percent finer by weight on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve, respectively.

Wan and Fell <Citation citationKey="Wan2008" /> indicated that the Burenkova method <Citation citationKey="Burenkova1993" /> does not provide a clear boundary between
internally stable and unstable soils. As illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-24" /> and <FigReference figKey="figure-25" />, they performed
logistic regression to define contours of equal probability of internal instability as a function of <em>h′</em> and <em>h″</em> for silt-sand-gravel
and clay-silt-sand-gravel soils of limited clay content and plasticity and sand-gravel soils with less than 10 percent non-plastic fines.

<EquationReference equationKey="equation-6" /> defines the probability contours of internally
unstable soils (
<em>
  P<sub>IUS</sub>
</em>
) or the probability of internal instability (
<em>
  P<sub>IUS</sub>
</em>
) from the logistic regression.

<Equation equationKey="equation-6" equation="P_{IUS}=\frac{e^Z}{1 + e^Z}" />

where

<Equation equationKey="equation-7" equation="Z=2.378 log⁡(h'')- 3.648h'+3.701" />

for silt-sand-gravel soils and clay-silt-sand-gravel soils of limited clay content and plasticity, and

<Equation equationKey="equation-8" equation="Z = 3.875 log⁡(h'' )-3.591h'+2.436" />

for sand-gravel soils with less than or equal to 10 percent non-plastic fines.

<FigReference figKey="figure-25" /> illustrates Burenkova <Citation citationKey="Burenkova1993" />
had a second zone (Zone III) of suffusive soils.
{'\n'}Wan and Fell (2004) <Citation citationKey="Wan2004" /> did not test soils in this range. These
soils have a concave downward shape, and they indicated such soils are uncommon and are expected to
be internally stable.

This worksheet assesses the susceptibility of broadly graded and gap-graded soils using the modified Burenkova method of
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Wan2008" />. Soils having a finer fraction of less than 15 percent may not be adequately assessed by this method.

Calculating <em>h′</em> and <em>h″</em> is the same as the Burenkova Method worksheet. Two options, discussed in
[Silt-Sand-Gravel Soils and Clay-Silt-Sand-Gravel Soils](#silt-sand-gravel-soils-and-clay-silt-sand-gravel-soils) and [Sand-Gravel Soils](#sand-gravel-soils),
are provided, depending on the applicable soil classification.

## Silt-Sand-Gravel Soils and Clay-Silt-Sand-Gravel Soils

Option 1 evaluates silt-sand-gravel soils and clay-silt-sand-gravel soils of clay-size fraction (<em>CF</em>, finer than 0.002 millimeter) less than
or equal to 10 percent and <em>PI</em> less than or equal to 12. Based on the particle-size analysis on the Gradation worksheet, the <em>CF</em> is
interpolated using logarithmic scale for particle size (0.002 millimeter) and linear scale for percent finer by weight. The soil classification is
also obtained from the Gradation worksheet. If Atterberg fines limits testing was performed, the <em>PI</em> is obtained from the Gradation worksheet.
If Atterberg fines limits testing was not performed, the <em>PI</em> has a gray background.

<EquationReference equationKey="equation-9" /> estimates the probability of internal instability (
<em>
  P<sub>IUS</sub>
</em>
) by combining Equations 6 and 7.

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-9"
  equation="P_{IUS}=\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(2.378 \log(h'') - 3.648h' + 3.701)}}"
/>

<FigReference figKey="figure-26" /> is an example of the output. Five logistic regression lines of
probability are plotted as dashed black lines for reference (5, 25, 50, 75, and 95 percent
probability of internal instability) and the soil being evaluated is plotted as a blue dot. The
Burenkova <Citation citationKey="Burenkova1993" /> Zone I boundary for suffusive soils is plotted as
a red dashed line for reference.

If the <em>CF</em> is greater than 10 percent or the <em>PI</em> is greater than 12, values that do not meet the criteria for the method have an
orange background. If the <em>CF</em> cannot be interpolated or Atterberg limits testing of the fines was not performed, use judgment to determine
whether the soil is of limited clay content and plasticity.

The soil being evaluated is plotted even if one or more criteria is not met or not calculated on the Gradation worksheet. Therefore, use judgment to
determine if Option 1 is applicable.

/>

The plot options are the same as the Burenkova Method worksheet.

## Sand-Gravel Soils

Option 2 evaluates sand-gravel soils with less than 10 percent non-plastic fines (<em>FC</em>, percentage finer than 0.075 millimeter). Based on the
particle-size analysis on the Gradation worksheet, the <em>FC</em> is interpolated using logarithmic scale for particle size (0.075 millimeter) and
linear scale for percent finer by weight. The soil classification is also obtained from the Gradation worksheet. If Atterberg limits testing of the
fines was performed, the <em>PL</em> is obtained from the Gradation worksheet. If Atterberg limits testing of the fines was not performed, the

<em>PL</em> has a gray background.

<EquationReference equationKey="equation-10" /> combines Equations 6 and 8 to estimate the
probability of internal instability (
<em>
  P<sub>IUS</sub>
</em>
).

<Equation
  equationKey="equation-10"
  equation="P_{IUS}=\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(3.875 \log(h'') - 3.591h' + 2.436)}}"
/>

<FigReference figKey="figure-27" /> is an example of the output. Five logistic regression lines of
probability are plotted as dashed black lines for reference (5, 25, 50, 75, and 95 percent
probability of internal instability), and the soil being evaluated is plotted as a blue dot. The
Burenkova <Citation citationKey="Burenkova1993" /> Zone I boundary for suffusive soils is plotted as
a red dashed line for reference.

If the <em>FC</em> is greater than 10 percent or the <em>PL</em> is not NP, values that do not meet the criteria for the method have an orange
background. If the <em>FC</em> cannot be interpolated or Atterberg limits testing was not performed, use judgement to determine whether the soil has
limited non-plastic fines.

The soil being evaluated is plotted even if one or more criteria is not met or not calculated on the Gradation worksheet, so use judgement to
determine if Option 2 applies. The plot options are the same as the Burenkova Method worksheet.
