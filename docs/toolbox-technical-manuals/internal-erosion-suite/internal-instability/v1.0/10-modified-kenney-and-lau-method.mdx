# Modified Kenney and Lau Method

Kézdi <Citation citationKey="Kezdi1979"/> and Kenney and Lau <Citation citationKey="Kenney1985" /> <Citation citationKey="Kenney1986" />
are two of the earliest to assess the susceptibility to internal instability. Li and Fannin <Citation citationKey="Li2008" /> summarized
and compared the two methods. The secant slope of the particle-size distribution curve indicates the likelihood of internal instability. Both
methods examine the slope of the gradation curve over a discrete interval of its length, but the criterion to establish the size of that interval
differs, as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-32" />.

Kézdi calculates Terzaghi’s <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{D'_{15}}{d'_{85}}"/> filter ratio over the constant increment of percent finer by mass
(<em>H</em>) of percent at any point along the gradation curve, where <em>D'<sub>15</sub></em> is the particle-size diameter corresponding to 15
percent passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve in the coarse fraction and <em>d'<sub>85</sub></em> is the particle-size diameter
corresponding to 85 percent passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve in the finer fraction. In other words, the Kézdi criterion
for internal instability is “the slope is flatter than 15% per four times change in particle size.” Kenney and Lau calculate
the <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F}" /> stability index over the increment of <em>D</em> to 4<em>D</em>. In other words, the Kenney and Lau
criterion for internal instability is “the slope is flatter than F% per four times change in particle size.”

Kenney and Lau <Citation citationKey="Kenney1985" /> <Citation citationKey="Kenney1986" /> converted cumulative particle-size distribution curves
into shape curves, or <em>H</em>-<em>F</em> plots, where <em>F</em> is the mass fraction smaller than particle diameter <em>D</em> (plotted on
the x-axis) and <em>H</em> is the mass fraction between particle diameter <em>D</em> and 4<em>D</em> (plotted on the y-axis).
An <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F}" />stability index over the increment <em>D</em> to 4<em>D</em>, which increases in magnitude with
progression along the gradation curve, determines if a soil is potentially unstable.

The shape curve is compared to Kenney and Lau’s criterion for internal instability. In 1985, they proposed the following criterion for internal
instability based on laboratory testing results, as shown in <EquationReference equationKey="equation-11" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-11" equation="\frac{H}{F} < 1.3" />

This criterion was subsequently revised in 1986 to <EquationReference equationKey="equation-12" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-12" equation="\frac{H}{F} < 1" />

They concluded that the fraction of loose particles within a soil matrix has a maximum value corresponding to whether the gradation is narrowly graded
(NG) or widely graded (WG). For NG soils <EquationNoRef equation="(C_u \leq 3)" />, the fraction of loose particles within the soil matrix is less than
approximately 30 percent of the total material. For WG soils <EquationNoRef equation="(C_u \gt 3)" />, the fraction of loose particles is less than approximately 20
percent. Since internal instability depends on the loss of loose particles from within the soil matrix, the fraction of the soil gradation for
{"\n"}<EquationNoRef equation="F \gt 20" /> percent for WG soils and <EquationNoRef equation="F \gt 30" /> percent for NG soils is not considered unstable
if it falls below the <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F} \lt 1" /> line. Vertical boundary lines are plotted from <em>H</em> = 0 to <em>H</em> = <em>F</em>
to represent these values. The resulting unstable zone is triangular and bounded on the left by the <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F} \lt 1" />
line and on the right by <em>F</em> = 20 percent for WG soils or <em>F</em> = 30 percent for NG soils. If any portion of the shape curve falls within
the applicable triangle, that fraction of the soil gradation is considered internally unstable. <FigReference figKey="figure-33" /> illustrates the
original (1985) and modified (1986) internal instability criteria in (<em>H</em>,<em>F</em>) space.

Converting the soil gradation into a shape curve can also evaluate the Kézdi method. Whereas the mass increment (<em>H</em>) between particle
diameter <em>D</em> and 4<em>D</em> for the Kenney and Lau methodology increases along the gradation curve, the mass increment (<em>H</em>)
over <em>D'<sub>15</sub></em> and <em>d'<sub>85</sub></em> for the Kézdi methodology is constant and equal to 15 percent. The resulting unstable
zone is rectangular and bounded at the top by <em>H</em> = 15 percent. If any portion of the shape curve falls within the rectangle, that
fraction of the soil gradation is considered internally unstable.

Based on a review of laboratory test results in <FigReference figKey="figure-34" />, Li and Fannin <Citation citationKey="Li2008" /> concluded
that the Kenney and Lau criterion of <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F} \lt 1" /> is a more precise boundary for internal instability for <em>F</em>
less than 15 percent, and the Kézdi criterion of <em>H</em> = 15 percent is a more precise boundary for internal instability for <em>F</em> greater
than 15 percent.

As a result, they proposed an approach that combined the two criteria for assessing the susceptibility to internal instability. As
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-35" /> illustrates, the resulting unstable zone is trapezoidal, bounded on the left by the Kenney and Lau criterion
(<EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F} \lt 1" />), on the top by the Kézdi criterion (<EquationNoRef equation="H \lt 15" /> percent), and on the right
by <EquationNoRef equation="F \lt 20" /> percent for WG soils or <EquationNoRef equation="F \lt 30" /> percent for NG soils. If any portion of the
shape curve falls within the applicable trapezoid, that fraction of the soil gradation is considered internally unstable.

This worksheet assesses the susceptibility of broadly graded and gap-graded soils using the modified Kenney and Lau method of Li and Fannin
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Li2008" />. As <FigReference figKey="figure-36" /> illustrates, the shape curve is obtained based on the particle-size
analysis on the Gradation worksheet. These calculations are displayed at the bottom of the worksheet and are not in the print range.

<FigReference figKey="figure-37" />, <FigReference figKey="figure-38" />, and
<FigReference figKey="figure-39" /> display the calculated shape curve as a blue line along with the
individual (<em>F, H</em>) pairs. The figures display points plotting in the unstable zone as red
circles, and points plotting in the stable zone as green circles.

The minimum stability index <EquationNoRef equation="(\frac{H}{F})_{min}"/> is determined based on the calculated <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F}"/>
ratios for the individual (<em>F,H</em>) pairs, and the mass passing (<em>F</em>) where <EquationNoRef equation="(\frac{H}{F})_{min}"/> occurs is linearly
interpolated from the shape curve. The coefficient of uniformity (<em>C<sub>u</sub></em>) from the Gradation worksheet is also displayed if sufficient
particle-size data is available for its calculation.

To define the appropriate boundary for the unstable zone, the primary soil fabric must be characterized as widely graded <EquationNoRef equation="(C_u \gt 3)" /> or
narrowly graded <EquationNoRef equation="(C_u \leq 3)" />. Use the drop-down list to select the primary soil fabric. When it is calculated, coefficient of
uniformity can directly inform the user-specified primary soil fabric; otherwise, use judgment to select the most appropriate primary soil fabric.
Based on the user-specified primary soil fabric, the trapezoidal shape of the unstable soil is plotted as a black dashed line, and a description of
the three applicable criteria (<EquationNoRef equation="\frac{H}{F} \lt 1" />, <EquationNoRef equation="H \lt 15" /> percent, and either widely graded criterion of <em>F = 20</em> percent for widely graded soils or
narrowly graded criterion of <em>F = 30</em> percent for narrowly graded soils) is displayed.

<FigReference figKey="figure-40" /> illustrates an example gradation plot. The cumulative
particle-size distribution is plotted as a blue solid line beneath the shape curve. Locations of
particle-size deficiency (for gap-graded soils) or self-filtering deficiency (for broadly graded
soils) driving the susceptibility to internal instability appear as red circles.
