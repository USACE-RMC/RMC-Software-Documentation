# Modified Kenney and Lau Method

Kézdi (1979) and Kenney and Lau (1985, 1986) are two of the earliest to assess the susceptibility to internal instability.
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Li2008" /> summarized and compared the two methods. The secant slope of the particle-size distribution curve indicates
the likelihood of internal instability. Both methods examine the slope of the gradation curve over a discrete interval of its length, but the
criterion to establish the size of that interval differs, as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-32" />.

Kézdi calculates Terzaghi’s filter ratio over the constant increment of percent finer by mass (<em>H</em>) of percent at any point along the
gradation curve, where is the particle-size diameter corresponding to 15 percent passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve in the
coarse fraction and is the particle-size diameter corresponding to 85 percent passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve in the finer
fraction. In other words, the Kézdi criterion for internal instability is “the slope is flatter than 15% per four times change in particle size.”
Kenney and Lau calculate the <em>HF</em> stability index over the increment of <em>D</em> to 4<em>D</em>. In other words, the Kenney and Lau criterion
for internal instability is “the slope is flatter than F% per four times change in particle size.”

Kenney and Lau (1985, 1986) converted cumulative particle-size distribution curves into shape curves, or <em>H</em>-<em>F</em> plots, where <em>F</em>
is the mass fraction smaller than particle diameter <em>D</em> (plotted on the x-axis) and <em>H</em> is the mass fraction between particle diameter

<em>D</em> and 4<em>D</em> (plotted on the y-axis). An <em>HF</em> stability index over the
increment <em>D</em> to 4<em>D</em>, which increases in magnitude with progression along the
gradation curve, determines if a soil is potentially unstable.

The shape curve is compared to Kenney and Lau’s criterion for internal instability. In 1985, they proposed the following criterion for internal
instability based on laboratory testing results, as shown in <EquationReference equationKey="equation-17" />.

They concluded that the fraction of loose particles within a soil matrix has a maximum value corresponding to whether the gradation is narrowly graded
(NG) or widely graded (WG). For NG soils (<em>C<sub>u</sub></em>≤3), the fraction of loose particles within the soil matrix is less than
approximately 30 percent of the total material. For WG soils (<em>C<sub>u</sub></em>>3), the fraction of loose particles is less than approximately 20
percent. Since internal instability depends on the loss of loose particles from within the soil matrix, the fraction of the soil gradation for

<em>F</em>>20 percent for WG soils and <em>F</em>>30 percent for NG soils is not considered unstable
if it falls below the <em>HF</em> &lt 1 line. Vertical boundary lines are plotted from <em>H</em> =
0 to <em>H</em> = <em>F</em> to represent these values. The resulting unstable zone is triangular
and bounded on the left by the <em>HF</em> &lt 1 line and on the right by <em>F</em> = 20 percent
for WG soils or <em>F</em> = 30 percent for NG soils. If any portion of the shape curve falls within
the applicable triangle, that fraction of the soil gradation is considered internally unstable.
<FigReference figKey="figure-33" /> illustrates the original (1985) and modified (1986) internal
instability criteria in (<em>H</em>,<em>F</em>) space.

Converting the soil gradation into a shape curve can also evaluate the Kézdi method. Whereas the mass increment (<em>H</em>) between particle diameter

<em>D</em> and 4<em>D</em> for the Kenney and Lau methodology increases along the gradation curve,
the mass increment (<em>H</em>) over and<em></em> for the Kézdi methodology is constant and equal to
15 percent. The resulting unstable zone is rectangular and bounded at the top by <em>H</em> = 15
percent. If any portion of the shape curve falls within the rectangle, that fraction of the soil
gradation is considered internally unstable.

Based on a review of laboratory test results in <FigReference figKey="figure-34" />, <Citation citationKey="Li2008" /> concluded that the Kenney and
Lau criterion of <em>HF</em> &lt 1 is a more precise boundary for internal instability for <em>F</em> less than 15 percent, and the Kézdi criterion of

<em>H</em> = 15 percent is a more precise boundary for internal instability for <em>F</em> greater
than 15 percent.

As a result, they proposed an approach that combined the two criteria for assessing the susceptibility to internal instability. As
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-35" /> illustrates, the resulting unstable zone is trapezoidal, bounded on the left by the Kenney and Lau criterion
(<em>HF</em> &lt 1), on the top by the Kézdi criterion (<em>H</em> &lt 15 percent), and on the right by <em>F</em> &lt 20 percent for WG soils or <em>F</em> &lt 30
percent for NG soils. If any portion of the shape curve falls within the applicable trapezoid, that fraction of the soil gradation is considered
internally unstable.

This worksheet assesses the susceptibility of broadly graded and gap-graded soils using the modified Kenney and Lau method of
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Li2008" />. As <FigReference figKey="figure-36" /> illustrates, the shape curve is obtained based on the particle-size
analysis on the Gradation worksheet. These calculations are displayed at the bottom of the worksheet and are not in the print range.

The minimum stability index (<em>HF</em>)<em><sub>min</sub></em> is determined based on the calculated <em>HF</em> ratios for the individual (<em>F,
H</em>) pairs, and the mass passing (<em>F</em>) where (<em>HF</em>)<em><sub>min</sub></em> occurs is linearly interpolated from the shape curve. The
coefficient of uniformity (<em>C<sub>u</sub></em>) from the Gradation worksheet is also displayed if sufficient particle-size data is available for
its calculation.

To define the appropriate boundary for the unstable zone, the primary soil fabric must be characterized as widely graded (<em>C<sub>u</sub>>3</em>) or
narrowly graded (<em>C<sub>u</sub>≤3</em>). Use the drop-down list to select the primary soil fabric. When it is calculated, coefficient of
uniformity can directly inform the user-specified primary soil fabric; otherwise, use judgment to select the most appropriate primary soil fabric.
Based on the user-specified primary soil fabric, the trapezoidal shape of the unstable soil is plotted as a black dashed line, and a description of
the three applicable criteria (<em>HF &lt 1, H &lt 15</em> percent, and either widely graded criterion of <em>F = 20</em> percent for widely graded soils or
narrowly graded criterion of <em>F = 30</em> percent for narrowly graded soils) is displayed.
