# Screening

This worksheet provides general characteristics to initially screen a soil's susceptibility to internal instability based on the shape of the
gradation curve.

## Coarse, Broadly Graded Soils Typically of Glacial Origin

In self-filtering soils, the coarse particles prevent the internal erosion of the medium particles, and the medium particles prevent internal erosion
of the fine particles. Soils which potentially do not self-filter are also susceptible to internal instability.

According to Sherard <Citation citationKey="Sherard1979" />, soils are generally considered internally unstable if the coarser fraction of the material does
not filter the finer fraction. Sherard obtained data from a number of embankment dams where sinkholes appeared on the crest and slopes of widely
graded embankments of glacial origin and plotted a band around these gradations. The internally unstable soil gradations usually plotted as nearly
straight lines or slight curves. The soils have a volume of fine particles greater than the volume of voids between the coarse sand and gravel
fraction, and the coarser particles float in the finer particles.

As the example in <FigReference figKey="figure-18" /> illustrates, the user-specified gradation from the Gradation worksheet is plotted against
Sherard’s unstable band for screening these characteristics.

## Broadly Graded Soils with a Flat Tail of Fines and Gap-Graded Soils

<FigReference figKey="figure-19" /> illustrates the two examples from Fell et al.
<Citation citationKey="Fell2008" /> of gradations susceptible to internal instability: a broadly
graded soil with a flat tail of fines and a gap-graded soil. Broadly graded soil has a wide range of
particle sizes (e.g., cobbles and gravels with sands, clays, and silts) with excessive fines that
plot as a flat tail on the gradation curve. Gap-graded soil has a broad gradation in which a
distinct portion (range of particle sizes) is significantly under-represented or completely absent.
As illustrated, the finer fraction is the point of inflection for broadly graded soils and the fine
limit of the gap for gap-graded soils.
