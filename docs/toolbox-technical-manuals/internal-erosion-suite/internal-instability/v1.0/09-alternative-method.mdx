# Alternative Method

Wan and Fell (2008) <Citation citationKey="Wan2008" /> determined that the methods of Kenney and Lau (1985, 1986) <Citation citationKey="Kenney1985"/>
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Kenney1986" /> or Sherard (1979) <Citation citationKey="Sherard1979" /> were too
conservative for silt-sand-gravel and clay-silt-sand-gravel soils. Based on their experience with the modified Burenkova method, soils with a steep
slope on the coarse fraction and a flat slope on the finer fraction were likely internally unstable. They developed an alternative method for broadly
graded silt-sand-gravel soils using the ratios of <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{D_{90}}{D_{60}}" /> and <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{D_{20}}{D_{5}}" />,
where <EquationNoRef equation="D_{90}" />, <EquationNoRef equation="D_{60}" />, <EquationNoRef equation="D_{20}" />, and <EquationNoRef equation="D_{5}" />
are the particle sizes corresponding tov90, 60, 20, and 5 percent finer by weight on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve, respectively.

Wan and Fell (2008) <Citation citationKey="Wan2008" /> identified two boundaries related to internal instability, as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-28" />.
The first is associated with a low likelihood of internal instability (or stable zone), and the second is associated with a very high likelihood of
internal instability (or unstable zone). A transition zone is between these two zones where both stable and unstable soil gradations were observed.

## Applicability

This worksheet assesses the susceptibility of broadly graded silt-sand-gravel soils to internal instability using the Wan and Fell (2008)
{"\n"}<Citation citationKey="Wan2008" /> alternative method. This method is not applicable to gap-graded soils, and soils that have a finer fraction
less than 20 percent may not be adequately assessed by this method. While it has not been proven by tests, Wan and Fell (2008) <Citation citationKey="Wan2008" />
indicated if the slope of the finer fraction is used in lieu of the <EquationNoRef equation="\frac{D_{20}}{D_5}" /> ratio, the method should
be applicable.

In step 1, the user-specified gradation from the Gradation worksheet is plotted as a black line against the stable gradations (green lines) and
unstable gradations (red lines) used to develop the method for visual comparison, as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-29" />.

## Susceptibility to Internal Instability

In step 2, the susceptibility to internal instability of the user-specified gradation is assessed. Based on the particle-size analysis on the
Gradation worksheet, <em>D</em><sub>90</sub>, <em>D</em><sub>60</sub>, <em>D</em><sub>20</sub>, and <em>D</em><sub>5</sub> are interpolated using
logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent finer by weight to calculate the x-axis value <EquationNoRef equation="\displaystyle \frac{30}{log(\frac{D_{90}}{D_{60}})}" />
and y-axis value <EquationNoRef equation="\displaystyle \frac{15}{log(\frac{D_{20}}{D_5})}" />.

<FigReference figKey="figure-30" /> is an example of the particle-size analysis and graphical output. The zone boundaries are plotted as black dashed
lines, with red text indicating the unstable zone, green text indicating the stable zone, and black text indicating the transition zone. The evaluated
soil is plotted as a blue dot which can be compared to the zones to estimate if the soil is potentially susceptible to internal instability.

<FigReference figKey="figure-31" /> shows the plot options for <FigReference figKey="figure-30" />. The minimum and maximum values for the x-axis
<EquationNoRef equation="\displaystyle \frac{30}{log(\frac{D_{90}}{D_{60}})}" /> and y-axis
{'\n'} <EquationNoRef equation="\displaystyle \frac{15}{log(\frac{D_{20}}{D_5})}" /> are user-specified.
