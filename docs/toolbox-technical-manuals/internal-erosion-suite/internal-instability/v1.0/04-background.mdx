# Background

Internal instability describes the susceptibility of a soil to seepage-induced movement and loss of fine particles in the soil matrix. Various terms
have been used in technical literature and research to describe the internal erosion mechanism associated with internally unstable soils, often
inconsistently.

Suffusion is defined as selective erosion of finer particles from the matrix of coarser particles (that are in point-to-point contact) of an
internally unstable soil such that the finer particles are removed through the voids between the coarser particles by seepage flow, leaving behind a
soil skeleton formed by the coarser particles. The voids are underfilled such that the volume of finer particles fits within the voids formed by the
coarser particles. Therefore, effective stresses do not load the finer particles. The seepage-induced mass loss results in little or no change in
volume and an increase in hydraulic conductivity particles as illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-8" /> <Citation citationKey="Fannin2014"/>.

Suffosion is a similar process. However, the voids are overfilled such that the coarser particles float within the finer particles, and effective
stresses load the finer particles. The seepage-induced mass loss results in a reduction in volume and a change in hydraulic conductivity particles as
illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-9" />. Suffosion is less likely under the stress conditions and gradients typically found in embankment
dams.

Both processes associated with internally unstable soils are secondary or contributing mechanisms that can lead to one of the primary mechanisms of
internal erosion.

Several methods have been proposed to assess susceptibility to internal instability based on particle-size analysis. This toolbox assesses the
geometric condition for initiation (susceptibility to internal instability) for the following methods:

- Burenkova method <Citation citationKey="Burenkova1993" />

- Modified Burenkova method for broadly graded and gap-graded soils <Citation citationKey="Wan2004" />

- Alternative method for broadly graded soils <Citation citationKey="Fell2008" />

- Modified Kenney and Lau method for broadly graded and gap-graded soils <Citation citationKey="LiFannin2008" />

- It also includes the suggested method for mechanism and amount of erosion for broadly graded soils <Citation citationKey="Douglas2019" />

Correctly applying these methods requires understanding the context from which each method was developed as described in the following sections. These
methods, along with sensitivity analysis, can be used as the first step to estimate the susceptibility to internal instability. If, by using such
methods, the soil is clearly not susceptible to internal instability and erosion of fine particles, it is unlikely that further effort is necessary.
However, if such methods lead to uncertainty, laboratory tests should be conducted on actual soil gradations that carefully simulate the field
conditions.
