# Burenkova Method

Based on three representative soil fractions (<em>D</em><sub>90</sub>, <em>D</em><sub>60</sub>, and <em>D</em><sub>15</sub>),
Burenkova <Citation citationKey="Burenkova1993" /> characterized the heterogeneity of cohesionless sand-gravel soils, with maximum particle sizes up to
100 millimeters and coefficients of uniformity up to 200, using two conditional factors of uniformity (<em>h′</em> and <em>h″</em>), as shown in
{"\n"}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-3" /> and <EquationReference equationKey="equation-4" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-3" equation="h'=\frac{D_{90}}{D_{60}}" />

<Equation equationKey="equation-4" equation="h''=\frac{D_{90}}{D_{10}}" />

where

> <em>D<sub>90</sub></em> = particle size corresponding to 90 percent finer by weight on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve  
> <em>D<sub>60</sub></em> = particle-size diameter corresponding to 60 percent passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve  
> <em>D<sub>15</sub></em> = particle-size diameter corresponding to 15 percent passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve

According to Wan and Fell (2008) <Citation citationKey="Wan2008" />, the value of <em>h′</em> represents the slope of the coarse part of the particle-size
distributio plot, with high values of <em>h′</em> representing near single-size coarse particles having large constriction spaces compared to a
well-graded soil. The value of <em>h″</em> is a measure of the filter action between the coarse fraction and the finer fraction.

<FigReference figKey="figure-20" /> illustrates laboratory test results plotted on a
semi-logarithmic diagram and divided into four zones, with Zones I and III representing zones of
suffusive soils, Zone II representing a zone of non-suffusive soils, and Zone IV representing a zone
of artificial soils. The domain of the Zone II (non-suffusive soils) was approximated by the
following inequalities defining the Zone II boundaries, as shown in
{'\n'}<EquationReference equationKey="equation-5" />.

<Equation equationKey="equation-5" equation="0.76 log⁡(h'') + 1< h'< 1.86 log⁡(h'') + 1" />

Based on the particle-size analysis on the Gradation worksheet, <em>D<sub>90</sub></em>, <em>D<sub>60</sub></em>, and <em>D<sub>15</sub></em> are
interpolated using logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent finer by weight to calculate the values of <em>h′</em>
and <em>h″</em>. <FigReference figKey="figure-21" /> illustrates an example of the particle-size analysis.

The results are plotted at the end of the worksheet. <FigReference figKey="figure-22" /> illustrates an example of the output. The Zone II boundaries
are plotted as black dashed lines. Red text indicates the suffusive Zones I and III, and green text indicates the non-suffusive Zone II. The
evaluated soil is plotted as a blue dot.
