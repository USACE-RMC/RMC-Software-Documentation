reportSubTitle: RMC Pipe Service Life Toolbox
reportAuthors: ["David Schaaf, Risk Management Center"]
reportAbstract: The spreadsheet tools contained in this toolbox assess the remaining service life of steel, aluminum, concrete, iron, plastic, and clay pipe materials, especially for the invert, when the existing condition is unknown due to lack of recent detailed inspection. This assessment supports the evaluation of the likelihood of a flaw or open defect existing which can lead to internal migration of the adjacent soil into the open defect or concentrated leak erosion adjacent to the pipe due to flow out of the open defect.
reportSubjectTerms: ["Pipe service life", "open defect", "perforation", "flow abrasiveness", "corrosion", "deterioration"]
