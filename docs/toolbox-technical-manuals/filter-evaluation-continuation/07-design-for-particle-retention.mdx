# Design for Particle Retention

Modern filter design criteria for particle retention are based on providing a no-erosion condition. The no erosion condition occurs when a filter material is sufficiently fine to seal with no erosion,
or practically no erosion, of the base material. This worksheet assesses the particle retention criterion for no erosion and helps to screen potential failure modes if no erosion is expected. If a filter
fails the no-erosion screening, the other erosion boundaries using the Foster and Fell <Citation citationKey="FosterFell2001" bibFile="/bibliographies/107-bib.json" /> method described in section 8 are
evaluated to assess how much erosion is required for self-filtering to occur and whether it can be tolerated.

## Base Soil Characterization

Step 1 characterizes the base soil. The fines content (_FC_), or percent passing the No. 200 sieve size by weight, of the finest base soil after regrading (if applicable) is obtained from the Base
Gradation worksheet, where it is interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent passing. The base soil category (BSC) is assigned based on the _FC_ of the
finest base soil after regrading (if applicable). Use the drop-down list to select whether the base soil is non-dispersive or dispersive. <FigReference parentDocId="107" figKey="base-soil-characterization" />
is an example of step 1.

## Filter Material Characterization

Step 2 characterizes the filter material. The coarsest _D<sub>15</sub>F_ is obtained from the Filter Gradation worksheet, where it is interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear
scale for percent passing. <FigReference parentDocId="107" figKey="filter-material-characterization" /> is an example of step 2.

## Particle Retention Criterion

Foster and Fell <Citation citationKey="FosterFell2001" bibFile="/bibliographies/107-bib.json" /> and Sherard et al. <Citation citationKey="Sherard1984" bibFile="/bibliographies/107-bib.json" /> show
that the measurable property of the filter that best defines its particle retention capability is the _D<sub>15</sub>_ of the filter (_D<sub>15</sub>F_). Research also shows that the correlation
between _D<sub>15</sub>F_ and the _d<sub>85</sub>_ of the base soil being protected by the filter (_D<sub>85</sub>B_) provides the best correlation for successful particle retention.

Sherard and Dunnigan <Citation citationKey="Sherard1985" bibFile="/bibliographies/107-bib.json" /> developed the No-Erosion Filter (NEF) test to find the ratio of _D<sub>15</sub>F_ and _D<sub>85</sub>B_
that establishes a no-erosion condition for non-dispersive base soils. Additional research by Foster and Fell <Citation citationKey="FosterFell2001" bibFile="/bibliographies/107-bib.json" /> at the
University of New South Wales (UNSW) helped in developing the no erosion condition for dispersive base soils. The results of the NEF and UNSW tests were used to develop the modern filter design criteria
for particle retention in FEMA <Citation citationKey="FEMA2011" bibFile="/bibliographies/107-bib.json" />.

Step 3 evaluates the no-erosion particle retention criterion by comparing the coarsest _D<sub>15</sub>F_ to the maximum allowable _D<sub>15</sub>F_ based on the BSC and knowing whether the base soil
is non-dispersive or dispersive. The criteria are a function of _D<sub>85</sub>B_ and _FC_, as shown in <FigReference parentDocId="107" figKey="particle-retention-not-met" />
and <FigReference parentDocId="107" figKey="particle-retention-met" />. If the coarsest _D<sub>15</sub>F_ is less than or equal to the maximum allowable _D<sub>15</sub>F_, “Meets” displays next to the
calculation. If the criterion is not met, “Fails” displays next to the calculation. A green background displays if the particle retention criterion is met, and an orange background displays if the
particle retention criterion is not met.

Based on the particle retention criterion, a statement appears after the calculations indicating if the filter material satisfies the no-erosion particle retention criterion or is too coarse to satisfy
the no-erosion particle retention criterion. If the particle retention criterion for no erosion is not met, use the Foster and Fell <Citation citationKey="FosterFell2001" bibFile="/bibliographies/107-bib.json" />
method to further evaluate the effectiveness of the filter material for particle retention. <FigReference parentDocId="107" figKey="particle-retention-not-met" />
and <FigReference parentDocId="107" figKey="particle-retention-met" /> are examples of the two possible scenarios for the no-erosion particle retention criterion.
