:::info NOTE

- If the slab fails due to uplift and stagnation pressure is not required to expose the underlying foundation, Node 2 on the "yes" branch of
  Node 1 can be assigned a probability of 1.0 or removed from the performance event tree.

- Node 2 can be expanded into several branches to account for differing gap widths and offset heights.

- Nodes 5 through 7 can be expanded to account for differing amounts of passive wedge removal (Node 5), evaluation of the PFM even if scour
  does not progress beneath the monolith(s) (Node 6), or differing scour widths (Node 7).
