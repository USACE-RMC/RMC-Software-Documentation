# Floodwalls (Shallow Foundation)

This section contains event trees related to **shallow foundation floodwall** failure modes.

:::info NOTE
Floodwall event trees were adapted from the potential failure mode progressions outlined in EM 1110-2-2502 Floodwalls and
Other Hydraulic Retaining Walls, published August 2022. To maintain consistency with the EM, all events in the failure
progressions are included as a separate nodes in the event trees. Some of these nodes are certain to occur (i.e., they have
a probability of 1.0). Event trees should be adjusted as necessary to fit site-specific conditions.
