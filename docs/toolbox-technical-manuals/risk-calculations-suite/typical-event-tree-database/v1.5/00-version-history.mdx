      "Embankment Slope Instabilty: Revised Node 1 description from 'Rainfall infiltration into crack, rapid drawdown, surcharge loading, etc. occurs?' to 'Decrease in shear strength or increase in load on the slope (i.e., increase in shear stress) occurs?'",
      "All Concentrated Leak Erosion PFMs: Revised description of Progression: Crack Stability nodes from 'Continuous stable roof forms over the crack or stable sidewalls are maintained along the crack?' to 'Continuous stable roof forms over the crack or stable sidewalls are maintained along the crack and do not swell shut?'",
      "Concentrated Leak Erosion (Homogeneous Embankment): Revised Node 1 description from “A continuous transverse crack exists…” to “A continuous transverse crack (or high-permeability zone) exists…”.",

      "Embankment Overtopping Erosion: Added the following note to the event tree: “Efforts to raise the dam or levee crest elevation prior to overtopping (Node 1) will affect the overtopping AEP and maximum water surface elevation, which could increase the differential head available to drive prior to overtopping PFMs. Raising the crest elevation could also result in the transfer of risk from one population to another (e.g., raising the levee crest in one location can result in premature non-breach overtopping flows in another location). Each of these effects should be evaluated in the risk analysis.",
