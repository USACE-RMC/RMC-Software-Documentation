# Concrete Dam Foundation Block Sliding

:::info NOTE
Structural potential failure modes are very dependent on site-specific conditions. Final performance event trees used in risk analyses
may vary significantly from the typical performance event trees provided in this database due to site-specific component configurations,
foundation conditions, and failure processes. Use of the typical structural performance event trees should be done with caution and
should be adjusted, as necessary.
:::

:::info NOTE
Nodes 2 through 5 are identical for the "Yes" and "No" branches of Node 1.
