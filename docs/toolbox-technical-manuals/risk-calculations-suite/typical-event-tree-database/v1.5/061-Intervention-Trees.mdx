# Intervention

:::info NOTE
Unsuccessful detection and intervention can be broken down as much as necessary for the project and should be placed appropriately
within the performance event tree being evaluated. It is not uncommon to have only one node dedicated to unsuccessful detection and
intervention, but the performance event trees on this page can also be used if a more complicated evaluation is necessary.
