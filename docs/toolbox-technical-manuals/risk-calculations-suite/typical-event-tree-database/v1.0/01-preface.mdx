# Preface

The RMC Typical Event Tree Database provides a database of typical performance event trees for common potential failure modes evaluated during
dam and levee safety risk analysis using the RMC Event Tree Toolbox. The typical performance event trees in the database should be used for
reference and updated as needed to fit project-specific needs.

This is the RMC Typical Event Tree Database version 1.0.

:::danger WARNING
This is an old version of the RMC Typical Event Tree Database. Refer to the latest version for current event trees.
