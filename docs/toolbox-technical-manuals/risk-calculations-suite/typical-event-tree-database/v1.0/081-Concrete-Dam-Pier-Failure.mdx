:::warning NOTE
Structural potential failure modes are very dependent on site-specific conditions. Final sub-event trees used in risk assessments may vary significantly from the example
sub-event trees provided in this database due to site-specific component configurations, foundation conditions, and failure processes. Use of the example structural
sub-event trees should be done with caution and should be adjusted, as necessary.
