:::info NOTE
Efforts to raise the dam or levee crest elevation prior to overtopping (Node 1) will affect the overtopping AEP and maximum water surface
elevation, which could increase the differential head available to drive prior to overtopping PFMs. Raising the crest elevation could also
result in the transfer of risk from one population to another (e.g., raising the levee crest in one location can result in premature
non-breach overtopping flows in another location). Each of these effects should be evaluated in the risk analysis.
