# Radial Gate Failure Due to Trunnion Friction

:::info NOTE
Structural potential failure modes are very dependent on site-specific conditions. Final performance event trees used in risk analyses
may vary significantly from the typical performance event trees provided in this database due to site-specific component configurations,
foundation conditions, and failure processes. Use of the typical structural performance event trees should be done with caution and
should be adjusted, as necessary.

:::info NOTE

- Depending on the level of analysis, node 1 can be broken into multiple branches for trunnion friction (as shown) or can be simplified
  into a threshold trunnion friction value.

- Nodes 2 through 4 are identical for all branches of Node 1.
