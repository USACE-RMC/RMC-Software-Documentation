      'Embankment Overtopping Erosion: Added the following note to the event tree: “Efforts to raise the dam or levee crest elevation prior to overtopping (Node 1) will affect the overtopping AEP and maximum water surface elevation, which could increase the differential head available to drive prior to overtopping PFMs. Raising the crest elevation could also result in the transfer of risk from one population to another (e.g., raising the levee crest in one location can result in premature non-breach overtopping flows in another location). Each of these effects should be evaluated in the risk analysis.',

      'Embankment Overtopping Erosion: Node 4: Revised title from “Headcut Continuation” to “Continuation” and description from “Embedded non-erodible feature fails to arrest headcut advance?” to “No embedded non-erodible feature exists to arrest erosion or headcut migration?”',
