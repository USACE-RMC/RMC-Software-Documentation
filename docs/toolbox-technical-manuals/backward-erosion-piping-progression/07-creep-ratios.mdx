# Creep Ratios

Creep ratio methods such as Bligh <Citation citationKey="Bligh1910" bibFile="/bibliographies/108-bib.json"/> and
Lane <Citation citationKey="Lane1935" bibFile="/bibliographies/108-bib.json"/> are empirical methods still used by some practitioners to
assess the likelihood of BEP progression (hydraulic condition) based on observations of seepage performance for a range of soil types.
Both empirical methods involve estimating the line of creep (or seepage path length) beneath concrete structures (such as weirs),
including seepage barrier walls. For embankment dams and levees, the seepage path length includes the impervious embankment, as well
as any upstream/floodside and downstream/landside impervious blankets or berms, seepage barrier walls, impervious foundation trenches,
etc. as illustrated in <FigReference parentDocId="108" figKey="creep-geometry"/>.

To assess the likelihood of BEP progression (hydraulic condition), the creep ratio for the headwater level under consideration is compared
to the minimum (or safe) creep ratio for the piping material. The creep ratio is calculated as the line of creep (seepage path length)
divided by the net hydraulic head. For Lane’s method, horizontal seepage path lengths are weighted three times less than the vertical seepage
path lengths to account for the greater resistance to pipe development when a vertical structure (such as a seepage barrier wall) is present
in the path of the pipe. Hence, it is often referred to as a weighted creep method. BEP progression is expected if the creep ratio is less
than the minimum creep ratio.

Evaluating creep ratio is informative where the levee consists of fine-grained material and no landside blanket exists. The method is not
appropriate for a compromised confining layer overlying a confined aquifer. Duncan et al. <Citation citationKey="Duncan2011" bibFile="/bibliographies/108-bib.json"/>
state that while informative, the creep ratio is considered a “quick-and-dirty check.” The state of practice is to use rational methods
based on blanket theory, flow nets, or finite-element method analysis, and the greatest remaining value of creep ratios lies in indicating
the relative erosion potential of various soil types.

## Line of Creep

Step 1 calculates the line of creep (seepage path length) as illustrated in <FigReference parentDocId="108" figKey="creep-input"/>. The
input includes the horizontal impervious dimensions as well as the depth of any vertical structures (such as seepage barrier walls). The
depth of vertical structures is doubled in the line-of-creep calculation because seepage must pass down, around, and up the embedded structure.
If a blanket, berm, or vertical structure does not exist, input zero for those values.

The line of creep (L) for Bligh’s method is calculated using Equation 26. The weighted line of creep for Lane’s method (LW) is calculated
using Equation 27.

$$
L = L_1 + W + L_2 + 2D \tag{26}
$$

$$
L_W = \frac{L_1 + W + L_2}{3} + 2D \tag{27}
$$

Where:

> _D_ = depth (feet) of embedded vertical structure  
> _L1_ = length (feet) of upstream/floodside impervious blanket or berm  
> _L2_ = length (feet) of downstream/landside impervious blanket or berm  
> _W_ = width (feet) of base of concrete weir or impervious embankment

## Minimum Creep Ratio

Step 2 characterizes the foundation to obtain the minimum (or safe) creep ratio for both empirical methods from
Lane <Citation citationKey="Lane1935" bibFile="/bibliographies/108-bib.json"/> based on soil type as illustrated
in <FigReference parentDocId="108" figKey="creep-material-input"/>. Use the drop-down list to select the material that best represents
the material along the piping path.

When seepage exits horizontally, piping can progress with an average horizontal gradient in the foundation as low as 0.05. This critical
horizontal gradient is approximately the same as the inverse of Bligh’s creep ratio for fine sand. The field horizontal critical gradient
for BEP progression (_i<sub>ch</sub>_) is the inverse of the minimum (or safe) creep ratio if there are no vertical structures (_D_ = 0). The
field horizontal critical gradient is calculated using Equations 28 and 29 for Bligh’s method and Lane’s method, respectively. For _D_
greater than zero, “N/A” displays for _i<sub>ch</sub>_.

$$
i_{ch} = \frac{1}{C_{min}} \tag{28}
$$

$$
i_{ch} = \frac{1}{C_{W,min}} \tag{29}
$$

Where:

> _C<sub>min</sub>_ = minimum (or safe) creep ratio for Bligh’s method  
> _C<sub>W,min</sub>_ = minimum (or safe) weighted creep ratio for Lane’s method

## Creep Ratio

Step 3 calculates the creep ratio by dividing the line of creep from step 1 by the net hydraulic head (_ΔH_) for the headwater level under
consideration. The creep ratio for Bligh’s method (_C_) is calculated using Equation 29. The weighted creep ratio for Lane’s method
(_C<sub>W</sub>_) is calculated using Equation 30.

$$
C = \frac{L}{\Delta H} = \frac{L}{(HW - TW)} \tag{29}
$$

$$
C_W = \frac{L_W}{\Delta H} = \frac{L_W}{(HW - TW)} \tag{30}
$$

Where:

> _ΔH_ = net hydraulic head (feet)  
> _HW_ = headwater level (feet)  
> _TW_ = tailwater level (feet)  
> _L_ = line of creep for Bligh’s method (feet)  
> _L_W_ = line of creep for Lane’s method (feet)

The calculated creep ratio is compared to the minimum creep ratio from step 2, and cells where the calculated creep ratio exceeds the
minimum value have an orange background. <FigReference parentDocId="108" figKey="creep-deterministic-tabular-output"/> illustrates the
tabular summary.

The calculated creep ratio is plotted as a function of headwater level for both methods. Horizontal reference lines display the minimum
(or safe) creep ratios for each method. <FigReference parentDocId="108" figKey="creep-deterministic-graphical-output"/> illustrates the
grpahical output. The legend can be moved within the plot area as necessary for clarity.

<FigReference parentDocId="108" figKey="creep-deterministic-plot-options"/> illustrates the plot options for this chart. The maximum 
value for the y-axis (creep ratio) and minimum and maximum values for the x-axis (headwater level) are user-specified. Users can input 
up to five vertical reference elevations, and user-specified labels displayed at the top of the chart.

By selecting the chart and then selecting the filter icon to display the filter pane, the data series for display can be selected as
illustrated in <FigReference parentDocId="108" figKey="creep-deterministic-filtering"/>. For example, if only the results from the Bligh’s
method are judged applicable, the data series for “Lane’s Weighted Creep Ratio” and “Lane’s Safe Weighted Creep Ratio” can be deselected
so that they do not plot or display in the legend.
