# Overtopping Evaluation Process

To inform the evaluation of embankment overtopping performance (i.e., likelihood of failure given the loading), a table (or matrix) of
conditional probability of failure (i.e., system response probability, SRP) as a function of erodibility coefficient (<em>k<sub>d</sub></em>) and
undrained shear strength (<em>s<sub>u</sub></em>) is constructed using WinDAM C. For efficiency, critical shear stress (&tau;<sub>c</sub>) is
typically conservatively assumed to be zero, and the other input parameters are modeled as discrete variables.

If the selected combination of <em>k<sub>d</sub></em> and <em>s<sub>u</sub></em> result in a breach intiation time greater than zero in WinDAM C
(i.e., headcut breaches upstream crest regardless of breach size), a value of 1 is entered in the table. Otherwise, a value of 0 for no failure/breach
is entered in the table. Users typically quickly get a feel for where failure occurs to focus their efforts and efficiently populate the matrix.

The process is repeated for a series of hydrographs that are scaled so that the peak stage corresponds to the peak overtopping depths of interest
(e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 ft, etc.) to fully assess the system response. The end-product of this phase of the evaluation is a series of system response matrices
corresponding to the peak overtopping depths of interest. A generic example is shown below.

The toolbox performs a probabilistic analysis using 1,000 iterations. Values of <em>k<sub>d</sub></em> and <em>s<sub>u</sub></em> are randomly sampled based on a
user-specified triangular distribution. The toolbox assumes <em>k<sub>d</sub></em> and <em>s<sub>u</sub></em> have a -1.0 correlation (perfectly negative). This
will be conservative.

Although not required to perform a probabilistic analysis, Palisade @RISK software (standalone version or as part of the Palisade DecisionTools Suite) can customize
the probabilistic analysis. If a probabilistic analysis is selected using @RISK to customize the probabilistic analysis, the minimum, most likely, and maximum values
are input, and an @RISK formula for a triangular distribution is used as a default. However, a valid @RISK distribution can be input in lieu of this default formula.
The correlation matrix named "Corr" must be added to the end of the user-specified input distributions for <em>k<sub>d</sub></em> and <em>s<sub>u</sub></em> using the
@RISK RiskCormat property function. Use RiskCormat(Corr,1) for <em>k<sub>d</sub></em> and RiskCormat(Corr,2) for <em>s<sub>u</sub></em>.

A user-defined function (UDF) performs two-way linear interpolation to obtain the SRP for each iteration (<em>k<sub>d</sub></em> - <em>s<sub>u</sub></em> pair). The
iteration results are tabulated, and the average SRP value is calculated as shown in the generic figure below.

 This process is repeated for each peak overtopping depth.
