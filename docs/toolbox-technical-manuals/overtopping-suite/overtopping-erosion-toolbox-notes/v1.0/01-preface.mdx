# Preface

The Risk Management Center (RMC) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed a suite of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to support
risk assessments for dam and levee safety. Each analysis suite is composed of multiple toolboxes (Microsoft Excel workbooks), and each toolbox
contains multiple spreadsheet tools or calculation worksheets (Microsoft Excel worksheets).

The Physically Based Breach Model worksheet in this toolbox deterministically and probabilistically assess the likelihood of embankment breach
from overtopping erosion using physically based model results (such as WinDAM C) and user-specified erodibility parameters for the embankment.

The information from these spreadsheet tools, along with other pertinent information, informs judgment when developing a list of more and
less likely factors and estimating probabilities. USACE best practice for estimating probabilities is to use the best available and multiple methods,
but all final probabilities are estimated using team elicitation based on the totality and strength of the evidence.

The RMC continuously works to improve the performance of RMC software; report possible bugs directly to the RMC at the address listed below. Ideally,
report suspected errors in written form with a description of the problem and the steps that lead to its occurrence. Suggestions for improvement are also welcomed.
