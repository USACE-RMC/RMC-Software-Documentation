# Background

The effects of local soil conditions on ground motion characteristics must be considered when designing and evaluating structures. Ground motion
amplification in soil relative to hard rock is illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-8" />. According to Federal Emergency Management Agency publication <em>Earthquake-Resistant
Design Concepts: An Introduction , Seismic Provisions for New Buildings</em> (FEMA P-749) (2nd ed.) <Citation citationKey="FEMA2022" />, hard, competent rock
efficiently transmits shaking with high-frequency (short-period) energy content but tends to attenuate shaking with low-frequency (long-period) energy
content. Deep deposits of soft soil transmit high-frequency motion less efficiently but tend to amplify the low-frequency energy content.

A site response analysis can determine the importance of these effects. However, site class is a simplified method for characterizing the ground
motion attenuation and amplifying effects during an earthquake. Site class is defined in terms of the average shear wave velocity in the upper 100
feet of the site profile. Shear waves generated by an earthquake create the strongest horizontal shaking, which is most damaging to structures. Soft
soils with lower shear wave velocities generally produce greater amplification than stiff soils with higher shear wave velocities.

The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) Recommended Seismic Provisions defines a suite of site classes to which typical ground
motion attenuation and amplification effects are assigned. Site Class A represents a “hard rock” condition, typically found only in the eastern United
States. Site Class B represents a “firm rock” condition in the upper 100 feet and indicates limited amplification at the ground surface of predicted
bedrock motions. Site Classes C through E represent increasingly looser or softer soil conditions with progressively increasing amplification. Site
Class F represents unstable soils requiring site-specific site response analyses.

The site classification procedure is incorporated into seismic design standards and building codes. The RMC Seismic Hazard Curves Toolbox uses the
site coefficients in the general procedures in the American Society of Civil Engineers/Structural Engineering Institute’s <em>Minimum Design Loads and
Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures</em> (American Society of Civil Engineers [ASCE]/Structural Engineering Institute [SEI] 7-16) <Citation citationKey="ASCE2017" />
to adjust the Site Class B/C hazard curve from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) legacy datasets for the user-specified site class. Since
these site coefficients may not be applicable to Site Class F, only Site Classes A through E are evaluated by the RMC Site Classification Toolbox.
