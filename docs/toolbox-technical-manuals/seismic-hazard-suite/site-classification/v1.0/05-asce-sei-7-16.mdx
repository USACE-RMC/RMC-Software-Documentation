# ASCE/SEI 7-16

This worksheet determines the site classification using ASCE/SEI 7-16 <Citation citationKey="ASCE2017" /> when site-specific site response analyses are not required. The site class
definitions are based on the average shear wave velocity of the upper 100 feet of the site profile. Measured shear wave velocities should be used for
site classification if they are available; however, often they are not available. If measured shear wave velocity data are not available, ASCE/SEI
7-16 <Citation citationKey="ASCE2017" /> provides alternate definitions of site class using the more readily available geotechnical parameters of standard penetration test (SPT)
resistance (N or blow count) for cohesionless soils and rock and SPT blow count and undrained shear strength for cohesive soils. Table 1 outlines the
six site classes as defined by ASCE/SEI 7-16 <Citation citationKey="ASCE2017" />.

## Soft Clay Layer

In step 1, the characteristics for Site Class E are evaluated for a total thickness of soft clay greater than 10 feet. A soft clay layer is defined by
the following criteria: undrained shear strength (<em>s<sub>u</sub></em>) less than 500 pounds per square foot (psf) as determined by the American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D2166, <em>Standard Test Method for Unconfined Compressive Strength of Cohesive Soil</em> <Citation citationKey="ASTM_D2166" />
or ASTM D2850, <em>Standard Test Method for Unconsolidated-Undrained Triaxial Compression Test on Cohesive Soils</em> <Citation citationKey="ASTM_D2850" />, moisture content (<em>w</em>) greater than or
equal to 40 percent as determined by ASTM D2216, <em>Standard Test Methods for Laboratory Determination of Water (Moisture) Content of Soil and Rock
by Mass</em> <Citation citationKey="ASTM_D2216" />, and a plasticity index (<em>PI</em>) greater than 20 as determined by ASTM D4318, <em>Standard Test Methods for Liquid Limit, Plastic
Limit, and Plasticity Index of Soils</em> <Citation citationKey="ASTM_D4318" />.

Each criterion is individually assessed (outside of this toolbox) based on the available site characterization data and judgment, and each criterion
that is met is selected using a drop-down list as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-9" />.

## Site Profile Characterization

If all three characteristics of a soft soil layer greater than 10 feet exist in step 1, step 2 is not evaluated, and conditional formatting applies a
gray background to step 2. These cells are not used in subsequent calculations even if data is present. If all three characteristics of a soft soil
layer greater than 10 feet do not exist in step 1, select the method of analysis to characterize the upper 100 feet of the site profile from the
drop-down list.

- Average shear wave velocity (method 1)

- Average SPT blow count for cohesionless soils, cohesive soils, and rock (method 2)

- Average SPT blow count for cohesionless soils and rock and undrained shear strength for cohesive soils (method 3)

The 100-foot site profile is subdivided into a maximum of 14 distinct soil or rock layers based on the site characterization data. Each distinct layer
is designated by a number from 1 to <em>n</em> (at the bottom of the site profile). The input includes depth (or elevation) below the ground surface
or structure, a description of the layer, and geotechnical parameters based on the selected method of analysis. If site-specific data are not
available to a depth of 100 feet, the soil and rock parameters must be estimated based on known geologic conditions and experience to extrapolate the
site profile to a depth of 100 feet. The distinct layer thicknesses are computed by subtracting the top and bottom depth (or elevation).

conditional formatting applies an orange background to both values to indicate one must be deleted. The sum of <em>d<sub>s</sub></em> and<em>

## Site Classification

In step 3, the site class is assessed for the selected method of analysis in step 2 as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-13" />. According to
ASCE/SEI 7-16 <Citation citationKey="ASCE2017" />, Site Classes A and B must not be assigned to a site if there are more than 10 feet of soil between
the rock surface and the bottom of the structure (or foundation).

For method 3, the site class is determined using both the average SPT blow count for cohesionless soils and the average undrained shear strength for
cohesive soils. If the site classes differ from these two methods, the site class with the softer site class is assigned. For the example data in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-12" />, the average SPT blow count for cohesionless soils of 26 bpf corresponds to Site Class D, and the average
undrained shear strength for cohesive soils of 923 psf corresponds to Site Class E. The site classification is the softer Site Class E.
