# Modern NSHM

The Modern NSHM worksheet facilitates the importing and processing of USGS modern datasets from the USGS Earthquake Hazard Toolbox ().

## Site and Model Input

Use the drop-down list to select the USGS national seismic hazard model (NSHM). Information about the models is customizable at the bottom of the
worksheet. Use dynamic data from the USGS Earthquake Hazard Toolbox, when available, because it is the most up-to-date model, and enter the version
number.

Use the drop-down list to select the source type such as total, fault, fault cluster, fault system, grid, interface, slab, or zone. The source types
are customizable at the bottom of the worksheet, and not all source types will be applicable to a given site based on the drop-down list in the USGS
Earthquake Hazard Toolbox.

The latitude and longitude of the site of interest are user-specified input. When entering the longitude, a minus sign must precede the input if it is
west of the prime meridian (e.g., locations in the United States). Conditional formatting applies an orange background if a user-specified latitude
or longitude input is outside the range of applicability for the selected model at the bottom of the worksheet, and a warning message is displayed.
The site and model input are illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-8" />.

Use the drop-down list to select the NEHRP site class (<Citation citationKey="FEMA2020" />). The RMC Site Classification Toolbox, part of the RMC
Seismic Hazard Suite, helps assess the site class. <TableReference tableKey="table-1" /> presents the eight site classes available to select for
modern datasets in the USGS Earthquake Hazard Toolbox as a function of small-strain shear wave velocity in the upper 30 meters (100 feet)
(V<sub>s30</sub>).

## Hazard Curve Input

The ground motion (GM) and corresponding annual frequency of exceedance (AFE) are obtained from the USGS Earthquake Hazard Toolbox. Values for up to
twenty-two ground motion intensity measures, excluding peak ground velocity (PGV), can be exported from the USGS Earthquake Hazard Toolbox as a
comma-separated values (CSV) file, a text file format that uses commas to separate values. <FigReference figKey="figure-9" /> is an example of hazard
curve data as it appears in the USGS Earthquake Hazard Toolbox, and <FigReference figKey="figure-10" /> is an example of the same data in Excel from
the exported CSV file.

  caption="Modern NSHM worksheet: Hazard curve input."

Copy GM-AFE data for each ground motion intensity measure of interest and paste as values in the appropriate cells. Clear any existing GM and AFE data
from cells with a light-yellow background so that residual data does not remain after pasting values. <FigReference figKey="figure-11" /> is an
example of the pasted GM and AFE data and calculated AEP.

USGS provides AFE; however, risk assessments need the annual exceedance probability (AEP). The AFE is the number of times the ground motion is
exceeded each year, and for very low ground motions, it may be above unity if a ground motion is exceeded multiple times each year. As the AFE becomes
less than unity, the frequency of exceedance becomes analogous to a probability, becoming nearly equal to the AEP for frequencies less than
approximately 1/100. Generally, structural performance and incremental risk are driven by these less frequent events, and there is little practical
difference between AEP and AFE. The toolbox adjusts the AFE values so subsequent calculations use probabilities. The relationship between AEP and AFE
is provided as <EquationReference equationKey="equation-1" />.
