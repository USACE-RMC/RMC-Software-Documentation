# Preface

The USACE Levee Screening Tool (LST) is a web-based tool developed by USACE to facilitate risk assessments for levees. The Levee Screening Tool is
intended by its developers to be a national tool to assess all levees in the Nation, not just levees in the USACE portfolio. The Levee Screening Tool
represents the most credible and least effort risk assessment process for levee systems. It supports collection, organization, evaluation, and
reporting of information about hazard exposure, levee performance and potential consequences of failure using existing information and efficient
analysis processes. With the tool, users combine engineering judgment available hazard (loading), performance, and consequence information to generate
risk estimates.

The resulting figures, findings, and reports that analysts produce with the LST can be used to inform risk characterization for a levee; providing an
improved understanding of the leveeâ€™s benefits and vulnerabilities. Ultimately, levee risk information plays an important role in risk-informed
decision making including the prioritization of risk management actions such as non-structural actions and/or structural repair or rehabilitation of
levees. Levees identified as higher risk through this screening process may be targeted for interim risk reduction measures and prioritized for more
robust risk assessments to reduce uncertainty. Levee screening results are communicated to owners, stakeholders, and the public to help prioritize
actions and increase risk awareness. Screening results are shared with Federal partners, including Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
consideration in the National Flood Insurance Program.

The LST methodology was developed by the USACE Risk Management Center and USACE Levee Safety Center. The Web-based Levee Screening Tool application is
coded and maintained by GEI Consultants Inc.

This manual is written for LST version 2.3.6, released in July of 2024.
