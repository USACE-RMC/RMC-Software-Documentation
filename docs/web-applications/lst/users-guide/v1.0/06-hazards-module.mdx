# Hazards Module

## Purpose of this module

A critical component of risk analyses is the degree of hazard imposed upon the
system of interest, which in this case includes the levee segment being screened. Hazard is distinct from the response of system components (which are
affected by hazard) and from the consequences (which result from distress or failure of system components); risk is a measure of how hazard affects
system response and possible resultant consequences. For screening-level risk assessments using the LST, flood (hydrologic) hazard is the only hazard
included. Seismic hazard should be discussed outside of the LST application for those rare occasions when they may drive system risk.

Information about the flood hazard is entered in the Hazards Module. This module has two tabs: the General Information tab and the Loading Functions
tab. The Loading Functions tab is where you enter the quantitative data used in the LST risk compute about the flood hazard, which is how often the
levee experiences different levels of loading. For the purposes of the LST, the hazard is described as the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of peak
stages for the entire range of flows that could load the levee. The LST does not consider seismic hazards.

Enter data about the age and methods used to estimate the Hazard Curves in the General Information tab. This provides the reviewers and
decision-makers information necessary to gage the quality and level of uncertainty associated with the hazard component of risk.

## Data and information guidelines, requirements, and sources

Follow these guidelines about collecting and processing data and information:

<CollectionList
  items={[
    'Base hydrologic and hydraulic inputs to the LST on readily available existing information',
    'Do not undertake new or updated analyses requiring more than a few hours’ worth of effort to obtain estimates of required inputs',
    'When no data or information exists, use professional judgment to estimate the required inputs and provide details in the appropriate Comments field',
    'Obtain data and information from published sources whenever possible',
    'Have a qualified hydraulic engineer on the screening team with experience in levee analysis and design review the data and information before using them in the levee screening process',
    'Consider any data or information that supports an improved estimate for the hydrologic and hydraulic inputs',
    'Although multiple data and information sources can be used and compared to improve the quality of the estimate, select a primary source to describe as input to the LST',
    'Document data and information sources in the applicable Comments field',
  ]}
/>

The types of hydrologic and hydraulic data and information that may be required for the levee assessment include:

## General Information tab

### Tab overview

The General Information tab consists of three sections:

<DocTabs
  items={[
    {
      title: 'Design Information',
      child:
        'Information related to the authorized capacity of the levee and considerations for future settlement or subsidence.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Historic Loading Information',
      child:
        'Often, the levee has experienced historic loads above given levels. This section provides to opportunity to add historic loading information.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Data Sources and Methods',
      child:
        'Describe the data sources and methods that are used to estimate the AEP values entered on the Hazard Curves tab.',
    },
  ]}
/>

Most of the answers are chosen from a given list of values, and each question is accompanied by a Comments text field for explaining the answer
selected.

### How the information on the General Information tab is used

The information entered on the General Information tab is used to assess the quality and quantity of available information for both individual levee
segments and from a portfolio perspective. The information may be used to inform levee risk classification by identifying and characterizing potential
sources of uncertainty. It can also be used to identify data gaps for the purpose of defining the scope and priority of further studies. None of the
information entered on this tab is used in the LST quantitative risk compute, but it is important that the screening team complete all fields as
accurately as possible.

## Loading Functions tab

### Tab overview

A loading function is also commonly referred to as a hazard curve or stage-frequency curve. Data entered on this tab are used in the risk compute. At
least one loading function is required. The loading function should represent the AEP for different water levels at the location on the levee segment
where performance issues are most likely to occur.

For most levee screenings, a single loading function that represents the AEP of different loading heights along the levee will be adequate. However,
if the AEP vs. loading height changes significantly along the segment it may be necessary to enter more than one loading function <em>if</em> one of
the following situations exist:

<ProcessList
  items={[
    'The loading function where concerns about one performance mode (e.g. closures or floodwalls) exists is significantly different that where other performance concerns exist, OR',
    'The loading function for the incipient overtopping location is significantly different than the loading function where performance concerns exist',
  ]}
  className="mb-6"
/>

:::warning[Minimum Requirement]
At a minimum, users must provide Elevations and AEP estimates for the levee toe (0% load), 100% load, and 100% load plus 3 feet.
:::

The LST will fit a semi-logarithmic curve through those points to complete the hazard curve for the
full range of events. However, you can enter stage-frequency pairs to better define the curve if
they are readily available for the levee segment in question.

Loading functions (stage-frequency) for levees typically trend toward a semi-logarithmic shape. This comes from an analytical Log-Pearson Type III
(LP3) flow frequency curve, which is approximately log-normal for skew values close to zero and exactly log-normal for zero skew. Stage-discharge
curves for prismatic channels tend to have a shape consistent with a second order polynomial. The combination of the flow frequency curve and the
stage-discharge curve produces a stage-frequency curve that is approximately semi-logarithmic. Many other factors, including upstream regulation and
channel geometry, can affect the shape of a flood hazard curves. In general, a semi-logarithmic shape is relatively common.

On the Loading Functions tab, enter the following information:

The specific Flood Probability tab inputs are described in more detail below.

#### AEP of water surface elevation at the levee toe (0%)

The AEP for water surface elevation at the levee toe is the AEP at which the levee system would first experience a flood loading large enough to
prevent flooding in the leveed area. It is typically based on the elevation of the landside toe. However, care should be taken to make sure the AEP
selected represents the point at which <em>the levee</em> (not pre-existing high ground) starts reducing risk in the leveed area.

To determine and enter the representative AEP value:

  items={[
    {
      title:
        'Estimate the levee toe water surface elevation using readily available information. Enter that water surface elevation in the Elevation (ft) column of the table',

          Estimate the AEP for <em>current</em> hydrologic and hydraulic conditions using available
          historical, discharge-probability, water surface elevation-probability, water surface
          elevation-discharge, and water surface profile-probability relationships
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      title: (
        <>
          Enter information about the AEP best estimate, hydrologic and hydraulic conditions, data
          sources, station location, gage location, etc., in the Comments field. If the project
          contains both embankment and floodwall alignments be sure to note both toe loading best
          estimates in the Comments field.'
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

#### AEP for additional water surface elevations (if available)

The AEP for additional water surface elevations, (e.g. 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total levee height) can provide a more accurate estimate of the
stage–frequency relationship of water on the levee. Additional entries can lead to a better estimate of overall risk, especially if the loading
function for the site in question is not well represented by a semi-logarithmic curve. To determine and enter additional representative AEP values:

<ProcessList
  items={[
    {
      title: "Determine the levee's current representative overall height",
      freeform: (
        <>
          If only one loading function is entered, use the distance from toe to top that is greatest
          along the segment. If multiple loading function are entered, use a representative height
          for the portion that is represented by the loadingfunction. This information should be
          based on original design document, as-built drawings, or other available information.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      title:
        'Estimate the water surface elevations necessary to load the levee to 25%, 50%, and 75% of the total height. Additional points can be entered if the data is readily available.',
    },

      title: (
        <>
          Estimate the ACE for each elevation under current hydrologic and hydraulic conditions

          relationships.'
        </>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

Note the ACE best estimate, hydrologic and hydraulic conditions, data sources, station location, etc., in the Comments field, ensuring all elevations
are in NAVD88. If the project contains both embankment and floodwall alignments be sure to note both best estimates in the Comments field.

#### AEP at top of levee (100%)

The AEP for the top of levee is the AEP for overtopping at the location for subject loading function. If only one loading function is used for the
segment, the AEP at top of levee must be the best estimate AEP for incipient overtopping of the segment, which is the AEP for when the levee segment
would first begin to overtop. To determine and enter the representative AEP value:

Estimate the stage for overtopping by comparing water surface profiles under current hydrologic and hydraulic conditions and corresponding elevation
surveys of the current top of levee from the levee profile. If this is not possible, follow these guidelines:

<ProcessList
  items={[
    {
      title: (
        <>
          When detailed profile data are not available, base the estimate on a comparison of
          available stage and top-of-levee information.
        </>
      ),
      child: [
        {
          title: (
            <>
              Consider the potential existence and location of low spots in the top-of-levee profile
              either by design due to superiority or resulting from settlement, modification, and
              other changes that may have occurred since construction of the levee system.
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          title: (
            <>
              Consider whether efforts to raise low spots in the levee are likely to be successful.
              If so, use the height, and associated AEP, for the incipient overtopping estimate.
            </>
          ),
        },
        {
          title: (
            <>
              Also consider potential changes in water surface elevation and profile characteristics
              that may have occurred since construction of the levee system due to changes in the
              watershed caused by upstream and/or downstream regulation, such as flood control,
              hydropower and navigation dams, sedimentation, vegetation, and the like to determine
              if the incipient overtopping location may be located somewhere other than the design
              location.
            </>
          ),
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      title: (
        <>
          When no data or information on incipient overtopping are readily available, use an
          estimate of the top of levee elevation at or near the downstream limit of the levee
          segment if it is reasonable to assume that first overtopping will occur near this
          location.
        </>

    },
    {
      title: (

          Use the location of a project gage if the benefit of having higher quality information at
          the gage site is judged to outweigh the potential benefits of identifying precisely the
          location of first overtopping.
        </>

          Base the ACE estimate on current hydrologic and hydraulic conditions using available

          elevation-discharge, and water surface profile-probability relationships.
        </>
      ),
    },

/>

Note the AEP best estimate, hydrologic and hydraulic conditions, data sources, station location, etc., in the Comments field, ensuring all elevations
are in NAVD88. If the project contains both embankment and floodwall alignments be sure to note both best estimates in the Comments field.

#### AEP at top of levee plus 3 ft (100% + 3 ft)

The AEP for the top of levee plus 3 ft is the AEP for a very large overtopping event at the location for subject loading function. Similar to values
below top of levee (100%), the LST will use the top of levee and top of levee plus 3 ft data to fit a semi-logarithmic function to define the
likelihood for the full range of events that overtop the levee. The location for this estimate should be the same as what was used for the overtopping
estimate (100%).

Estimate the stage for overtopping plus 3 ft by comparing water surface profiles under current hydrologic and hydraulic conditions and corresponding
elevation surveys of the current top of levee from the levee profile. In many cases, water surface elevations and corresponding AEPs will not be
available for events that overtop the levee by 3 feet. In that case, use judgement to extrapolate the existing information, while taking into
consideration specific information about the site (e.g. are there other terrain features that limit the ability of overtopping flows to spread out
such as narrow valley walls? etc.). <em>In many cases, an estimate one order of magnitude less frequent than the AEP of overtopping may be reasonable
if no other data exists.</em>

Note the AEP best estimate, hydrologic and hydraulic conditions, data sources, station location, etc., in the Comments field, ensuring all elevations
are in NAVD88. If the project contains both embankment and floodwall alignments be sure to note both best estimates in the Comments field.
