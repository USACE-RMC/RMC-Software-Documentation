# Appendix B - USACE Levee Loading and Incident Data (LLID)

## Executive Summary

The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has over 14,000 miles of levees within its portfolio spread across the continental United States,
Alaska, Hawaii, and across multiple U.S. territories. These levees are owned and operated by numerous different entities. To better understand the
risks associated with levees across their portfolio, USACE implemented a risk screening process around the 2007-2008 timeframe. Key to this risk
screening process was the development of assessment tools that could be used by USACE engineers to handle the risk calculations associated with
loading, performance, and consequences. The most important of these tools is the USACE Levee Screening Tool (LST). One of the critical pieces of the
LST is the development of performance metrics for the various features that are present within USACE levee segments. These performance metrics include
probability of breach prior to overtopping estimates as a function of loading height for embankments, floodwalls, and closure systems both with and
without flood fighting. Additionally, overtopping breach likelihood estimates, and general characteristics of breach sizes are included in a
probabilistic framework. These performance metrics were developed as part of a multi-year effort to painstakingly collect and categorize historic
performance data across USACE. This dataset is referred to as the USACE Levee Loading and Incident Dataset (LLID). The LLID not only serves as the
‘backbone’ of a critical part of the LST but is also used widely throughout the USACE Levee Safety Program for a variety of other purposes.

## Introduction

USACE has 2,890 levee segments under its jurisdiction. To better understand the risks across their entire portfolio, USACE has been developing
evaluation tools to assist with effort. The most significant of these tools is the LST. The LST was first initiated as a spreadsheet-based evaluation
tool back in the 2007-2008 timeframe. It has undergone several modifications since then and is now a web-based evaluation tool used by USACE to
estimate various risks associated with levees under their jurisdiction.

One of the critical parts of the LST relates to the performance of levee features (embankment, floodwall, closure systems, etc.) under hydraulic
loading. When the LST was first initiated, USACE did not have a comprehensive understanding of how levees across their full portfolio had historically
performed under loading. There were many known incidents of distress, but all this information was scattered individually among the various USACE
districts. There was no formal portfolio wide data set from which the agency could draw upon when developing the LST; therefore, the initial levee
feature performance data in the LST was estimated by expert judgment of a group of senior engineers within USACE with many years of levee design and
flood fighting experience. Soon thereafter, funding was provided to initiate a multi-year effort to collect and categorize historical levee
performance data across USACE to support several initiatives within the USAE Levee Safety Program. This effort has led to the development of a robust
data set that provides sufficient information upon which USACE can use to estimate levee performance with a much higher level of confidence.

## Initial Screening of USACE Levee Segment Portfolio

### Levee Embankment Segments Never Loaded > 25% of Loading Height

After reviewing historical performance information for numerous levee segments, it was determined that all levee embankment segments that have never
been loaded above ¼ of their levee loading height (see L<sub>H</sub> in <FigReference figKey="figure-209" />) could be screened out from
consideration with respect to historic levee performance. There were two primary reasons for establishing this initial screening criteria. First and
foremost, serious levee embankment distress has rarely been seen within the USACE portfolio when loading is below the 25% level based upon the
historical performance data. Secondly, the criteria allowed the team to focus on those segments which had been loaded more significantly and helped
reduce the overall portfolio to a more manageable number in terms of data collection and categorization.

<Figure

  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure209.png"
  alt="Levee embankment loading height."
  caption="Levee embankment loading height."
/>

It is important to note that the 25% loading height criteria for embankments was not used for initial screening of floodwalls. Floodwall loading
height represents the landside ‘stickup’ height measured from the top of the wall to the landside ground interface with floodwall. There are far fewer
segments with floodwalls that are part of the USACE portfolio when compared to embankment only segments. Wall sections associated with closure
systems are considered part of the overall superstructure of the closure itself and not floodwalls for the purposes of the performance dataset. An
initial screening for floodwall sections was not necessary given the overall number of levee segments with floodwall sections.

### Levee Segments Considered Non-Applicable for Evaluation

There are minor number of levee segments within the USACE portfolio that do not meet the general characteristics of a traditional levee. Examples
include levee segments that are actually spur dikes used to direct flow and not retain it from flooding, as well as levee segments that are routinely
loaded on both the water side and landside during periods of elevated flow. These segments were also screened out from consideration as part of the
dataset.

### Insufficient Data/Information Available for Evaluation

There are numerous segments that have been loaded over 25% of their levee height and act as traditional levees, but there simply isn’t sufficient
information that exists to accurately portray either their loading history and/or past performance. Load history for a levee segment is estimated by
determining both the approximate water level on the typical section and duration of loading. There needs to be daily water level data available along
the water source to accurately estimate historic loading events. This is usually done by using one or more water gages along the loading source. There
are several levee segments on smaller tributaries that have no gages or record of daily water levels, so it isn’t possible to accurately estimate a
daily loading level.

Additionally, there are several levee segments where there isn’t sufficient information to establish a reasonable typical section, basic embankment
materials, or reliable past performance information doesn’t exist. This is particularly true for rural segments that protect only agricultural land or
very small communities. Local authorities typically conduct their own flood fighting and aren’t required to report it to USACE. The levee segment may
be damaged during a flood event, but the local authorities can opt to fix those damages themselves without having to go through USACE for funding.

### Summary of Available Levee Segments for Evaluation

A total of 319 levee segments were screened out either due to historical loading never reaching the 25% embankment loading height or they were
considered non-applicable as a traditional levee. An additional 167 levee segments were screened out due to lack of sufficient information. This
leaves the total number of available segments for evaluation at 2,404 across the USACE portfolio.

## Overview of USACE Levee Segment Portfolio

### Geographical Breakdown by USACE Division

USACE has 38 district offices responsible for civil works infrastructure. Only one of these (Charleston District) has no levees under its
jurisdiction. The remaining 37 districts with civil works authority each have varying numbers of levees that fall under their program ranging from two
levee segments (Savannah District) to 353 available segments (Sacramento District). Each of the civil works district is categorized geographically by
regions (divisions) in the United States. Each division has multiple districts under its authority. <TableReference tableKey="table-12" /> provides
a breakdown of the USACE levee portfolio of available segments by division.

River, and San Joaquin River. MVD includes numerous segments on the Mississippi River and Illinois River.

### Breakdown by Construction Entity and Operation/Maintenance Responsibility

The 2,404 available levee segments can be sub-divided a variety of different ways depending upon what information is desired. One such breakdown of importance
is associated with the entity that constructed the levee segment and the group that is responsible for its operation and maintenance. Federally constructed
levee segments represent those that were either originally constructed by the U.S. government (typically USACE) or involved a significant
improvement/enlargement of an original private levee by USACE through separate congressional funding for a federal project. A locally constructed
levee is a levee segment that has been constructed by private/local interests and has been accepted into the USACE PL84-99 levee program after meeting
required standards. Most levee segments within the USACE portfolio are those that were constructed/improved by USACE and then turned over to local
interests for their operation and maintenance. A breakdown of the three construction and operation/maintenance categories across the portfolio is as
follows:

1. Federally constructed/improved and federally operated/maintained (FED/FED) – 212 segments (8.8% of overall portfolio)

1. Federally constructed/improved and locally operated/maintained (FED/LOCAL) – 1,695 segments (70.5% of portfolio)

1. Locally constructed and locally operated/maintained (LOCAL/LOCAL) – 497 segments (20.7% of portfolio)

Federally constructed/improved levee segments were typically designed by experienced civil engineers and built to a higher engineering standard that
locally constructed levees. Thus, the quality of important levee characteristics such as embankment materials, compaction requirements, floodwall
design and construction, placement of pipes, etc. are usually superior to those that were built without a similar level of design and oversight. The
same is generally true for operation and maintenance requirements. Those levee segments whose annual operating budgets are funded by larger entities
with a sufficient tax base (federal government, large cities/municipalities) tend to be better maintained according to the original design intent.
This plays an important role in the overall performance of the levee segment when significantly loaded.

## Summary of USACE Levee Background Information for Evaluated Segments

### Segments Evaluated by USACE Division

Districts within each division were visited to review and collect historic performance data. The availability of reliable historical performance data varied
greatly among the districts. Some districts had inspection and flood fight records that dated back to the original construction of the levee, while
others only had relatively recent performance data. Some districts had all their historic records scanned in electronic format while others had hard
copies in storage files. Sorting through the various amounts of data was both time consuming and difficult to match past loading events with
performance. <TableReference tableKey="table-14" /> provides a breakdown of levee segments evaluated for each USACE division.

Ideally, the overall percentage of segments evaluated by division would be similar the overall percentage of available levee segments by division
shown in <TableReference tableKey="table-12" />. While the team made sure at least a reasonable percentage of levees within each district were
evaluated, ensuring the overall percentages by division was similar to the overall portfolio breakdown wasn’t possible for each division. This is
primarily due to availability of reliable information, as well as loading history. Since levee distress tends to occur at higher loading levels, the
team focused initially on those levees that had seen historically significant loading events (greater than 75% of loading height). Some divisions
simply didn’t have enough levee segments with reliable performance data that had been loaded above the 75% loading height range. Every effort was made
to ensure a reasonable balance of different types of levee segments (urban, rural, construction entity, O/M responsibility, different states,
different river systems, etc.) were evaluated within each district and division.

### Segments Evaluated by Primary Feature

The primary features of USACE levee segments include embankments, floodwalls, closure systems, culvert gates, and interior drainage systems (primarily
pump stations). Each segment varies in terms of the number of features it contains. Some segments may have every type of feature, while others may
only have an embankment with no culverts, closure systems, or pump stations. Levee embankment sections are present in 97.5% of levee segments
evaluated. Floodwall sections are present in 135 (24.1%) of the segments evaluated. Drainage culverts are present along most levee segments to drain
interior surface water by gravity when the river is a normal or at low flow levels. Out of 561 segments evaluated, a total of 469 (83.6%) had at least
one gravity drainage culvert present along their alignment. Openings are many times constructed through the levee embankment or floodwall section to
allow access (road, rail, pedestrian, etc.) during periods of non-flooding. As river levels rise, the access openings are closed with temporary
structures (bulkheads, panels, swing gates, sandbags, etc.) so the interior remains protected. A total of 223 segments (39.8%) evaluated have a least
one closure system as part of the levee alignment.

### Urban/Rural Breakdown

Levee segments can also be categorized by their protected area setting. There are three setting categories: urban, rural, and mixed. Mixed setting
typically represents a levee that primarily protects agricultural/rural land, but also a portion of it also protects a small town/community. The type
of setting can have an influence on levee performance. Levees in urban areas tend to have a higher level of flood fighting during periods of distress
to protect homes, businesses, and infrastructure. There are more floodwalls in urban areas and historical maintenance tends to be better given the
life and economic risks involved. Documentation of the event is usually more thorough as well. The breakdown of levee segments evaluated per setting
type is 61.3% urban, 29.2% rural, and 9.5% mixed. Just because a levee is classified as urban doesn’t necessarily mean it protects it large city. Many
of the urban classified levees protect the residential/commercial areas of relatively small towns. The are still classified as urban since the line
of protection is almost exclusively for residents and commercial property.

### Primary Levee Embankment Soil Type

Classification of the primary embankment material was collected by the data evaluation team. The vast majority (97.5% of all evaluated segments) of
levees have an embankment as part of their line of flood protection. While levee embankment materials vary somewhat along their length, usually a
prevailing soil type can be established by reviewing available data. <FigReference figKey="figure-210" /> shows the distribution of levee embankment
primary soil types for the segments evaluated. The highest percentage of levee embankment material is classified as relatively homogeneous impervious
material (clays and silt/clay mixes) representing 40.0% of the overall segments. The next largest embankment material used consists of sand and
sand/silt mixes which is seen in 20.3% of all embankments evaluated. Gravel and sand/gravel mixes are the primary embankment material in 12.8% of
segments evaluated. Zoned construction with an impervious riverside slope face and crest overlying random fill or pervious material is present in
10.7% of the segments. Each of the remaining materials shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-210" /> represent less than 5% of the levee segments
when considered individually.

  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure210.png"
  alt="Breakdown of levee embankment segments evaluated by soil type"
  caption="Breakdown of levee embankment segments evaluated by soil type"
/>

### Embankment Construction Method

Levee embankments can be constructed by a variety of methods. Embankment material can be hauled to the site or simply excavated from an adjacent
borrow pit and then placed in lifts and compacted. More pervious, sandy embankments can also be constructed by hydraulic fill methods. Dredging of
adjacent waterways by dragline and placement is another means of embankment construction. Most USACE levee embankment sections are constructed without
specified zoning and are considered relatively homogeneous. The following bullet list provides the relative percentage of the primary construction
method used by segment:

1. Rolled earth fill – relatively homogeneous with no zoning = 74.2%

1. Varied earth fill – riverside and crest impervious layer over random fill/pervious material = 10.7%

1. Earth fill placed by unknown method – no zoning = 6.0%

1. Varied earth fill – impervious central core with random fill/pervious outer shells = 4.0%

1. Hydraulic sand fill = 2.3% (typically an enlargement of an existing embankment section)

1. Other = 2.8%

The ‘Earth fill placed by unknown method’ category typically represents LOCAL/LOCAL levee segments where construction records aren’t available, but
the embankment material is such that it could have been placed by different procedures.

### Floodwall Type

There are approximately 114 miles of floodwall included in the segments that have been evaluated. The two predominant types of floodwall types are
concrete capped I-walls and non-pile founded T-walls. Concrete capped I-walls make up 47.8% of the total floodwall mileage evaluated. Non-pile founded
T-walls make up 33.2% of the overall floodwall mileage evaluated. Other wall types evaluated include steel sheetpile I-walls with no cap (3.4%),
pile-founded T-walls (8.3%), other wall types (7.2%), and unknown types (0.1%). L-walls are included as part of the T-wall summary due to their
similarities in design and performance. Other floodwalls types include gravity sections, counterfort walls, old masonry walls, and any other type not
included within the list.

## Pertinent Information Categorized for Each Segment

### Loading Range and Duration

Various sources of data were used to determine the typical loading height for each levee and/or floodwall parts of a segment. As-built plans, National
Levee Database (NLD) survey data, NLD cross-sections, LST briefing materials, Periodic Inspection (PI) reports, and various other sources of data
were referenced to determine a reasonable estimate for typical cross-sections. Once this was determined for a segment, daily water data from gages was
used in combination with daily flood fight reports and photographs to ensure the load acting on the levee section each day was within a specified
range. The following load ranges (see <FigReference figKey="figure-209" /> for reference) were established for the incident dataset:

1. Below Landside Toe

1. Landside Toe – 25% L<sub>H</sub> (representative average of 12.5% L<sub>H</sub>)

1. 25 - 50% L<sub>H</sub> (representative average of 37.5% L<sub>H</sub>)

1. 50 – 75% L<sub>H</sub> (representative average of 62.5% L<sub>H</sub>)

1. 75 – 90% L<sub>H</sub> (representative average of 82.5% L<sub>H</sub>)

1. 90% - Widespread Overtopping (representative average of 95% L<sub>H</sub>)

1. Widespread OT – 1.0 feet OT

1. 1.0 – 3.0 feet OT

1. Greater than 3.0 feet of OT

Once the peak loading for the event was determined, the next step was to estimate the duration of loading. For the purposes of the LLID, duration is
defined by the number of consecutive days the levee is loaded above the landside toe (embankment) or floodwall/landside ground interface (floodwall).
When end of one loading event and beginning of the next were spaced within a few days of one another and the water level remained near the landside
toe level, this was counted as a single loading event since the embankment was likely still saturated/wet and the foundation remained loaded. The
following load duration ranges were estimated for each levee segment evaluated:

1. Less than 1 day (Flashy)

1. 1-2 days (Very Short)

1. 3-6 days (Short)

1. 7-14 days (Moderate)

1. 15-30 days (Long)

1. Greater than 30 days (Very Long)

For overtopping events, the load duration range represents the time from initial loading above the landside toe to the onset of widespread
overtopping. Loading below the landside toe has no duration load range.

### Performance Modes

Historic performance data for levee segments within the USACE portfolio were evaluated for multiple types of incidents prior to the onset of
widespread overtopping. The same flood event may result in multiple incidents occurring. An incident is defined as any one of the following occurring
prior to overtopping:

1. BREACH PRIOR TO OVERTOPPING – Failure breach of the levee embankment, floodwall section, flow through an open/failed closure system, or flow
   through a large open culvert gate closure prior to overtopping of the levee embankment/floodwall.

1. FLOOD FIGHT TO SAVE LEVEE - Flood fight actions taken prior to overtopping to prevent breach from occurring. Artificially raising the levee section
   to prevent overtopping is not considered a flood fighting action for the purpose of the LLID.

1. SYSTEM MALFUNCTION – Significant flooding of the interior prior to overtopping without breach occurring. Significant interior flooding without
   breach is defined as defined as any of the following occurring within the interior protected area:

1. Flooding of major infrastructure (highways, wastewater systems, power sub-stations, tunnels, pump stations, etc.)

1. Flooding of important civic buildings (hospital, schools, churches, community centers, government offices, etc.)

1. Flooding of numerous residences/businesses

1. 10% of interior urban area beyond designated ponding areas

1. 25% of interior rural area beyond designated ponding areas

1. FLOOD DAMAGE > $ 1 MILLION (FY20 $ value) – overall damage to levee segment not associated with overtopping results damages exceeding $1 million in
   2020 values.

The performance mode(s) that causes each incident has also been classified. Levee segment performance modes evaluated prior to widespread overtopping
include embankment through seepage/piping, embankment foundation seepage/piping, embankment instability, embankment erosion, floodwall instability,
floodwall foundation seepage/piping, closure system performance issues, culvert gate malfunction, and interior drainage system malfunction. The same
performance mode can be categorized across multiple incidents for the same event. For example, suppose a significant flood fight effort is required to
prevent a levee from breaching due to embankment foundation seepage/piping issues during a flood. Following the flood event, the USACE district and
local sponsor repair the area with a large landside seepage berm whose cost exceeds $1 million in 2020 values. This event would then have two
embankment foundation seepage and piping incidents, one for flood fighting to prevent breach and the other for a post flood damage exceeding $1
million. The same event can also have multiple performance modes. It is not uncommon to have issues associated with both seepage/piping and erosion
during the same event.

### Contributing Factors to Performance Modes

The team that developed the LST was originally tasked by USACE management to develop a simplified tool that could utilize the existing annual levee
inspection data as a potential means to rate individual performance modes for a segment. The concept developed by the team was to provide a series of
performance ratings for a ‘primary’ factor and group of ‘secondary’ factors within each performance mode. The primary factors were designed to carry
the most significance, but the secondary factor ratings would be used to both inform the primary factor rating, as well as mathematically adjust the
risk calculations depending upon how they were rated. The factors embedded in the existing inspection checklist were reviewed by the LST development
team and modified accordingly to their potential impact on the performance mode of the feature. As the historical performance data collection team
began reviewing district files, they documented which of these factors influenced performance. A summary of factors for each performance mode are
summarized herein.

#### Embankment Seepage/Piping (Both Through and Foundation)

The primary factor for both embankment through seepage/piping and embankment foundation seepage/piping was <em>Seepage</em>. This means the presence
of seepage exists or would be likely to exist when hydraulically loaded. Secondary factors pulled from the original inspection list and included in
the LST were <em>Animal Control, Cracking, Culvert/Discharge Pipes, Encroachments, Seepage Control System, Rutting, Settlement,</em> and
<em>Vegetation</em>. During the data collection effort, it was quickly determined by the team that additional factors should be added to the list to
document their relative importance related to this performance mode. These additional secondary factors included <em>Old Channel/Slough Crossing
Location, Previous Damage/Repair Area, Design/Construction Deficiency,</em> and <em>Other (Miscellaneous)</em>. Additionally, the original
<em>Culverts/Discharge Pipes</em> secondary factor was sub-divided into <em>Culvert/Pipes through Line of Protection</em> and <em>Landside
Culvert/Pipes</em>.

#### Embankment Instability

The primary factor used for embankment instability was <em>Slope Stability</em>. This factor indicates the presence of slope instability or sloughing
associated with the embankment. Original secondary factors included <em>Cracking, Encroachments, Settlement, Rutting,</em> <em>Seepage Control
Systems, </em>and<em> Vegetation</em>. Additional factors that were also collected based upon observations of historic performance data included
<em>Expansive Clay, Culvert/Pipe through Line of Protection, Previous Damage/Repair Area, Design/Construction Deficiency, Landside Culvert/Pipe,</em>
and <em>Other (Miscellaneous)</em>. <em>Expansive Clay</em> represents situations where highly plastic clays were used in the construction of the
embankment. These are highly susceptible to desiccation cracking and sloughing of the slope.

#### Embankment Erosion

The embankment erosion performance mode had a primary factor of <em>Erosion/Bank Caving</em>. This refers to the presence of embankment erosion and/or
bank caving occurring during a flood. Original secondary factors from the inspection checklist carried into the LST were <em>Sod Cover, Rutting,
Riprap Revetment/Bank Protection, </em>and <em>Revetment Other Than Riprap</em>. Additional factors collected by the data team based upon erosion
incidents were <em>Culvert/Pipe through Line of Protection, Encroachments, Previous Damage/Repair Area, Design/Construction Deficiency, Vegetation,
</em>and <em>Other (Miscellaneous)</em>.

#### Floodwall Instability

Floodwall instability had a primary factor of <em>Tilting/Sliding</em>, which represented the likelihood of having floodwall movement under loading.
Original checklist factors carried into the LST were <em>Concrete Surfaces, Foundation for Concrete Structures, Seepage Control Systems,</em> and
<em>Vegetation</em>. <em>Concrete Surfaces</em> was intended to reflect the general overall condition of the concrete section as it related to
cracking, spalling, etc. <em>Foundation for Concrete Structures</em> represented the erodibility of the foundation supporting the floodwall. Based
upon historic data collected, the following secondary factors were also collected: <em>Condition of Existing R/S Bank Protection, Culvert/Pipe through
Line of Protection, Encroachments, Design/Construction Deficiency, Landside Culvert/Pipe, Previous Damage/Repair Area,</em> and <em>Other
(Miscellaneous)</em>.

#### Floodwall Underseepage/Piping

The primary factor for floodwall underseepage/piping was the presence of <em>Seepage</em>. Original inspection checklist secondary factors carried
into the LST included <em>Culvert/Discharge Pipes, Encroachments, Seepage Control Systems,</em> and <em>Vegetation</em>. Based upon historical
floodwall underseepage incidents, the data collection team also noted the relative influence of <em>Design/Construction Deficiency, Previous
Damage/Repair Area,</em> and <em>Other (Miscellaneous)</em>. Similar to embankment seepage, <em>Culvert/Discharge Pipes</em> were sub-divided into
Culvert/Pipes <em>through the Line of Protection</em> and Landside Culvert/Pipes.

#### Closure Systems

As noted previously, the LST was originally setup as a simplified screening tool. Part of that simplification was to take a ‘weakest link’ approach
when evaluating various aspects of the levee system including closure systems. For example, it is common to have multiple types of closure systems
(post/panel, moveable gate, culvert gates, etc.) within the same segment. When engineers input information into the LST for a levee segment, they were
guided to assess the single closure system that was perceived to be most critical from a risk perspective. Therefore, a series of generic factors
were developed by the LST development team that could be adapted to any type of closure evaluated. The general factors included <em>Storage/Security,
Operational History/Access, Condition/Maintenance, Operation Plan/Experience,</em> and <em>Other (Miscellaneous)</em>. The primary factor varied based
upon the type of closure being assessed. As the data collection team reviewed performance information, it was determined additional factors should be
included relative to closure systems. These additional factors where information was collected included <em>Design/Construction Deficiency</em> and
<em>Previous Damage/Repair Area</em>.

#### Interior Drainage

Malfunctions of interior drainage systems (pump stations, drainage ditches, landside culvert/pipes, etc.) can lead to significant interior flooding;
however, as part of the overall initial simplification, USACE management made the decision to not consider interior drainage as part of the LST. This
was because interior drainage system malfunctions are less likely to cause life loss when compared to breaches prior to overtopping of other levee
features (embankments, floodwalls, etc.). Even though interior drainage wasn’t part of the LST, the data team opted to collect and categorize these
incidents knowing the information could be useful in the future. The contributing factors collected by the team related to interior drainage systems
included <em>Inadequate Pumping Capacity, Design/Construction Deficiency, Culvert/Pipe through the Line of Protection, Pump Station Malfunction,
Previous Damage/Repair Area,</em> and <em>Other (Miscellaneous)</em>. <em>Inadequate Pumping Capacity</em> only applies to situations where pump
stations are part of the levee system but simply do not have enough capacity to keep up with interior drainage and/or seepage.

### Overtopping Information

For the purposes of the LLID, overtopping was considered the point at which widespread flow over the crest of the levee segment occurs such that it
can no longer be artificially raised (sandbags, batter board, etc.). Isolated incipient overtopping locations that can easily be sandbagged or raised
by other means are not considered as overtopping events unless the levee district routinely allows them to overtop and flood the interior through this
isolated location. The estimated depth of overtopping and duration of flow over the levee section has been estimated where that information was
readily available. Many times, this couldn’t accurately be classified because the information regarding breach times and duration of flow were not
well documented, particularly for rural, non-federal levee segments. A total of 106 segments (18.9% of those evaluated) have overtopped at least once
during the periods of time in which they were evaluated for historic performance. Additionally, the number of breaches per overtopping event and
breach dimensions were captured when information was available.

## Embankment Performance Prior to Overtopping

### Embankment Breach Prior to Overtopping – All Performance Modes

There has been a total of 107 breaches of embankments prior to overtopping across the 547 segments with embankments that have been evaluated. Some of
these include multiple breaches of the same levee segment during different events. The distribution of these breaches by load range is shown in
{"\n"}<TableReference tableKey="table-15" /> along with the number of times each range has been loaded. The number of times loaded is collective
across the load ranges. This means the 615 loading events in the 90% - OT range are also included as part of each of the load ranges below the 90%
level since the water must pass through the lower ranges to reach higher levels. Performance of the levee segment in the lower ranges is accounted for
within the incidents. The corresponding breach probability by load range is the number of breaches within the load range divided by the number of
times it has been loaded in the same range. These values include the effects of flood fighting to save the embankment from breaching. The values in
{"\n"}<TableReference tableKey="table-15" /> are for all embankments types and performance modes combined.

### Embankment Flood Fight Effectiveness – All Performance Modes

As noted previously, the breach probability values shown in <TableReference tableKey="table-15" /> include the effects of flood fighting. There have
been many instances where flood fighting has kept a levee embankment section from breaching prior to overtopping. Determining how significant a flood
fight action is relative to projected performance is a bit subjective. For the purposes of the LLID, only those flood fight actions that were
determined to be critical based upon relative location of the flood fight action, extent of effort required, actions taken, and timing of the flood
fighting were significant enough to classify as saving the levee. One such example is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-211" /> where a series
of large sandbag rings has been placed at the landside toe of the levee during a major flood event. The relative size of the sandbag ring structure
and its location warrants a classification of flood fight to save the levee from breaching. Another example would be when emergency stone is placed
along the riverside slope when excessive erosion of the embankment or foundation is occurring during a flood event. When the levee section is being
actively eroded, and actions are taken to arrest it during a flood then the incident is documented as a flood fight to prevent breach from occurring.

To estimate the effectiveness of flood fighting all the instances where flood fight actions were taken to save the levee section from breaching were
combined with the breach prior to overtopping incidents to estimate breach prior to overtopping if flood fight actions had not taken place. This
information is provided in <TableReference tableKey="table-16" /> for all embankment performance modes.

<FigReference figKey="figure-212" /> shows a graphical comparison of the effectiveness of flood fighting across the USACE portfolio with respect to
embankment performance modes. The cross-hatched area represents the difference in performance as it relates to breach probability prior to overtopping
when accounting for flood fight actions taken to save the levee. This graph covers all embankment types and performance modes.

  caption="Graphical representation of flood fight (FF) effectiveness for levee embankments."
/>

Levee districts also take less significant flood fight measures during some flood events. There have been numerous instances where isolated small
sandbag rings have been used to control minor boils that were located well away from the toe of the levee. Another example of a non-critical flood
fight action would be when plastic sheeting is used ahead of an on-coming flood to prevent erosion damage to a section of levee that is in generally
in good condition. These are examples of preventative flood fight measures consider minor in nature and not included as a flood fight to save the
levee section from breaching.

## Floodwall Performance Prior to Overtopping

### Floodwall Breach Prior to Overtopping – All Floodwall Types

There has been a total of five known floodwall breaches prior to overtopping for the segments evaluated. All five breaches prior to overtopping were
associated with I-walls. Four of the five were concrete capped I-walls that breached during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. The other was a
steel sheetpile I-wall (no cap) that breached in 1972 along the Kingston-to-Exeter system (Baltimore District). This too was a result of a tropical
storm system causing extremely intense rainfall leading to a quick rise in the Susquehanna River.

Similar to the procedures outlined for embankments, flood fight actions to save floodwalls from breaching prior to overtopping have occurred for every
type of floodwall. Typical actions include utilizing sandbags to control excessive underseepage and piping of foundation material, using rock/gravel
to buttress the stability of a floodwall, and other miscellaneous actions. <TableReference tableKey="table-17" /> provides the probability of
floodwall breach both with and without the effects of significant flood fight actions. These values are reflective of all wall types. FW<sub>H</sub>
represents the stickup height of the floodwall which is measured from the landside ground/floodwall interface to the top of the floodwall.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-213" /> shows the effects of flood fighting as it relates to breach prior to overtopping for USACE floodwalls. This
has a similar shape as the graph for embankments (<FigReference figKey="figure-212" />) but the breach probabilities are significantly lower when
compared to embankment performance.

## Closure Systems Performance Prior to Overtopping

### Closure Systems – Background Information

There are a variety of different styles of closure systems within the USACE portfolio used for access through the levee embankment or floodwall
section when river levels are low to normal. These closure systems must be set properly and in a timely fashion to prevent flood water from flowing
through the access opening. The main types of closure systems within the USACE portfolio include sandbag closures, soil piles with plastic sheets,
soil baskets, stoplogs/bulkheads, post and panel style closures, and moveable gates (swing, roller, miter, etc.). It is not uncommon to have multiple
closure types within the same segment. Sandbag closures are known to be the most prevalent among the different types because of there is little-to-no construction
cost associated with them at the time the levee was built. While this is a significant benefit during original construction, there are some serious
drawbacks when it comes to sandbag closures. They can be slow to set in place depending upon the number of people involved. It takes a lot of people
to set large sandbag closures. Volunteers are often called upon to accomplish this task. There is a specific way to properly construct a sandbag
closure and most volunteers are unaware of the proper procedures for placing and interlocking bags together. This has led to performance issues. Other
closure types have their own issues as well. Proper storage, security, and inventory of post/panel and stoplog closures has been problematic for some
levee districts. Another common problem is modification of existing closure sill structures without approved authorization. There have been many
instances where county highway departments or other entities have paved over sill structures during street maintenance. The closure sill is critical
to the successful operation of the closure system and there have been instances where the local district wasn’t aware of the issue until a flood was
upon them and they discovered the sill structure was buried under layers of asphalt.

### Closure Systems – Breach Prior to Overtopping

For the purposes of the LLID, closure system breach is defined as flow through an access closure due to inability to successfully set the closure or
failure of the closure system after being set in place. There have been 24 documented closure system breaches across the 223 segments evaluated which
have at least one closure system along their alignment. The distribution of breaches by closure type and timing of the breach is provided in
{"\n"}<TableReference tableKey="table-18" />. Most closure system breaches are associated with sandbag closures. The reason for this is two-fold.
First, there are more sandbag closures within the overall USACE portfolio compared to other closure types. Secondly, sandbag closures were sometimes
included as part of the original levee construction when they shouldn’t have been due to the number of personnel required, flashiness of the water
source, or a combination of both. At least half of the sandbag closure breaches are because there was insufficient time and/or personnel to
successfully set the closure before the floodwaters arrived.

There have been documented flood fights to prevent flow through an open or threatened closure system. Some of these related to using emergency
materials when it was determined there wasn’t enough time to place a sandbag closure. Others significant flood fight actions include structurally
modifying and reinforcing deteriorated or missing structural frame pieces on a post and panel style closure. Finally, emergency actions to address
sill issues uncovered at the time of the flood have taken place to prevent flow into the landside area. <TableReference tableKey="table-19" /> shows

There a few important things to point out as it relates to the values provided in <TableReference tableKey="table-19" />. First, you will note that
the loading is set up as a function of the typical levee embankment or floodwall loading height instead of the closure system height. Given that there
can be many different closures at different elevations along the same segment, the decision was made to categorize performance as a function of the
embankment or floodwall loading height. This was done as a simplification because it would be extremely difficult, time consuming, and costly to
estimate the daily loading ranges for each closure system along a segment. Next, the reader will note differences in breach probability values between
actual performance and without flood fighting is less significant when compared to embankment or floodwalls. This primarily relates to the inability
to set the closure. In some closure system breach cases, it was realized too late that there would be no means to set the closure and the interior
flooded through the opening. Thus, there was no flood fighting to prevent flow through the open closure. Also, once a closure was successfully set,
usually it performed satisfactorily enough in most cases that significant flood fight efforts weren’t required.

## Overtopping Performance

### Embankment Only – All Embankment Overtopping Events

There have been 254 documented widespread overtopping events of embankments for segments evaluated. A total of 168 (66.1%) of these resulted in the
formation of at least one overtopping breach. There have been multiple embankment overtopping breaches within the same segment for the same event. For
the purposes of the LLID, only those overtopping breaches that occurred as a result of water pouring over the levee from the flood side to the
landside (protected) side are considered applicable. Breaches that resulted from the landside water levels filling up the interior and flowing back
over the levee into the river weren’t included. <FigReference figKey="figure-214" /> depicts a histogram of the number of overtopping breaches per
event for all embankments.

Several embankment overtopping events resulted in breaches but the number of breaches that occurred were either classified as ‘unknown’ or ‘multiple’.
These were included in the 168 overtopping breach occurrences, but not in the histogram in <FigReference figKey="figure-214" />. Given a breach
occurs, the average number of breaches is 2.85 when considering all embankments and overtopping depths. The average breach width was 440 feet with a
maximum width of 5,900 feet and minimum width of 15 feet. Breach width is defined as the distance measured along the alignment of the levee segment.

### Embankment OT Performance – Relative Erosion Resistance

The erosion resistance of the embankment material plays an important role in the overtopping performance. Embankment materials typically vary slightly
along the length of a segment but generally can be classified according to their relative erosion resistance. For the purposes of the LLID, the
following relative erosion resistance categories were used to better understand the performance of the embankment materials within the USACE
portfolio:

1. Higher Relative Erosion Resistant Soils - clay, clay/silt mix, clay with sand/silt, zoned embankment with impervious cover over riverside slope and
   crest, and clay enlargement of an existing levee embankment

1. Moderate Relative Erosion Resistant Soils - silt, clayey silt, silt with sand/clay, silt/clay mix with sand, silty loam, sandy clay, silty/clayey
   loam, sand/silt mix with clay, sand with silt/clay, and clayey sand

1. Lower Relative Erosion Resistant Soils - sand, silty sand, silty sand with gravel, sand/silt mix, sand/gravel mix, sand/gravel mix with silt, sandy
   silt, and sandy gravel

1. Other Relative Erosion Resistance Soils - random fill and impervious core with random fill/pervious shell

1. No Classification – insufficient information to accurately classify levee embankment material

<TableReference tableKey="table-21" /> provides additional embankment overtopping breach information by relative erosion resistance with respect to
number of breaches given a breach occurs, average breach width, maximum breach width, and minimum breach width. Numerous data sources were used to
gather this information including post flood repair reports/plans, post flood aerial imagery, and flood fight reports. There was insufficient
information to develop accurate data for both the ‘Other’ and ‘No Classification’ relative erosion resistance categories.

### Embankment OT Performance – Construction/Maintenance Quality

As noted previously in Section 4.2, levees within the USACE portfolio fall into three categories with respect to the entity that constructed or
significantly improved the levee and the group that is responsible for operating/maintaining it. FED/FED and FED/LOCAL levees were typically designed
and built to much higher engineering standards compared to LOCAL/LOCAL levees. FED/FED and FED/LOCAL segments typically used better quality soils for
levee embankments and were required to be compacted at higher levels and meet required design specifications. Most LOCAL/LOCAL levees were constructed
with minimal design and little-to-no engineering oversight.

Another key factor associated with successful levee performance is making sure the levee is properly operated and maintained. There are several
FED/LOCAL levee segments that were well designed and constructed by USACE before they were turned over to local entities and have since fallen into a
state of disrepair typically due to a lack of local resources. Even a well designed and constructed levee has a much higher likelihood of poor
performance if it isn’t properly operated and maintained.

Both the quality of construction and thoroughness of historical operation/maintenance play an important role in the performance of the levee segment.
This is especially true as it relates to overtopping performance. For the purposes of the LLID, two broad categories have been established to reflect
this issue. The first is federally constructed and well operated/maintained segments. The other category is LOCAL/LOCAL and reclassified federal levee
segments with poor operation/maintenance history. There have been 91 documented embankment overtopping events of federally constructed and well
operated/maintained segments within the USACE portfolio. Only 35 (38.5%) of these incidents resulted in an overtopping breach occurring. The remaining
163 embankment overtopping incidents occurred on LOCAL/LOCAL or reclassified federal levee segments. This resulted in 133 incidents where a minimum
of one breach occurred (81.6%).

### Embankment OT Performance – Relative Erosion Resistance Combined with Construction/Maintenance Quality

The differences in overtopping performance of embankments when combining the relative erosion resistance of the embankment material with the quality
of construction and operation/maintenance history is even more pronounced. This information is summarized in <TableReference tableKey="table-22" />.

### Embankment OT Performance – Relative Erosion Resistance, Construction/Maintenance Quality, and Overtopping Depth

Overtopping depth represents the height of water above the typical levee section either at the time that breach occurs or the maximum overtopping
depth for non-breach events. For the purposes of the LLID, embankment overtopping depth has been sub-divided into performance for three categories:
less than 1.0 foot of overtopping, 1.0 – 3.0 feet of overtopping, and greater than 3.0 feet of overtopping. In general, the greater the overtopping
depth then the higher the probability of an overtopping breach forming. An exception to this would be situations where the interior quickly fills
before a breach occurs and helps prevent the breach from happening or the duration of the event is very short (minutes to hours).
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-215" /> lists the probability of breach occurring as a function of relative erosion resistance, construction/maintenance
history, and overtopping depth. The relatively minor differences in overtopping performance for lower relative erosion resistance soils was ignored
as part of the simplification for LST 2.0 overtopping data.

### Floodwall Overtopping Performance

There have been 55 documented overtopping incidents of floodwall sections for the segments evaluated in the LLID. Almost all overtopping breaches of
floodwalls have occurred on I-wall sections. There has been one documented overtopping breach of a T-wall in the New Orleans District during Hurricane
Katrina. Floodwalls are generally more resilient to overtopping when compared to embankment sections especially when there is some type of erosion
protection (riprap, splash pad, asphalt, etc.) on the landside of the floodwall. This significantly restricts scouring of the passive resistant soil
that plays an integral role in floodwall stability. <FigReference figKey="figure-216" /> lists the likelihood of an overtop breach occurring for
different floodwall types.
