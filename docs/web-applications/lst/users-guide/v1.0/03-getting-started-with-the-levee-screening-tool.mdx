# Getting started with the Levee Screening Tool

This section provides a brief overview of the tasks that users complete with the Levee Screening Tool (LST). More information is provided in the other
chapters of this guide. The majority of user assistance is provided within the online tool through tool tip popups and integrated help messages.

## Screening process overview

A levee screening with the LST comprises these steps:

1. Collect relevant levee information and review.

1. Log in to the LST.

1. In the list of levee segments, find the levee segment you wish to assess.

1. Add/edit basic information about the levee segment and screening.

1. Add/edit hydrologic and hydraulic information pertaining to the levee segment. Develop a flood loading function.

1. Add/edit consequence information pertaining to the leveed area.

1. Complete inundation modeling and LifeSim computation

1. Rate the likelihood of applicable performance modes for the levee segment.

1. Link performance modes to hazard function(s) and consequence estimates.

1. Upload and/or identify supporting documentation. Ensure all justification fields are filled out and support the risk analysis.

1. Review and interpret results. Develop major findings.

1. Submit the screening to the first-tier reviewer.

1. Review the screening and reject/approve it (through multiple levels of review).

1. Track the screening’s status as it progresses through the review process.

1. Respond to reviewers’ questions and comments.

1. Produce final documents.

## Navigate to the tool and log in

To begin using the LST:

## View levee segment and screening information

### Get an overview of the levee system and its segment screenings

To get information about a levee segment and its screenings, begin at the Levee Screenings page and navigate to the desired levee system within the
Levee Screenings page via the search bar.

The Levee System Overview page displays all current and former levee screening rounds. A screening round represents a complete screening cycle. A new
round cannot be generated until the active round is complete.

The overview part of this page identifies:

1. System Name and System ID

2. The current System LSAC

3. System View screen: Provides system-level summary of results.

4. New Round: User can open a new screening round.

5. Go to NLD: sends user to the levee system NLD page to verify or update shared levee data between the NLD and LST.

Users can expand each round to display the levee segment(s) included in the system and general information about each levee segment along with update
date, status, LSAC, comment adjudication, warnings, and screening actions (<FigReference figKey="figure-10" />). The “Access to Inspect” question is
a Yes/No prompt that transitions the screening scope to a no access qualitative risk assessment. In practice, this is used for when an inspection
could not be completed due to right-of-entry issues which can occur on infrastructure such as non-project segments (roadways, railroads, and other
embankments) that are a part of a USACE levee system.

  alt="The two tabs in the Hazards module: General Information and Loading Functions"
  caption="The two tabs in the Hazards module: General Information and Loading Functions"
/>

For guidance on answering the Hydrology and Hydraulics module questions, see the <em>Hazards module</em> in this guide (Chapter 4).

### Consequences module

The Consequences module of the LST estimates loss of life and direct damages to structures and contents caused by flooding due to breach or
overtopping of a levee.

To reach the Consequences module from the Home page:

1. Navigate to the desired levee system within the Levee Screenings page

1. Click the “edit screening” icon of the desired levee segment (or start a new screening).

1. Click Consequences in the LST module navigation bar.

The Consequences module has five tabs:

- Inundation

- Structure Inventory

- LifeSim Compute

- Consequences Results

- Critical Infrastructure

The Structure Inventory tab is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-14" />. Each tab requires user input, verification of the data, and/or a
narrative summary entry. The final consequence results are displayed on the Consequences Results tab.

For guidance on using the Consequence module, see the chapter <em>Consequences module</em> (Chapter 5) in this guide.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-14"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure14.png"
  alt="The Structure Inventory tab in the Consequences module"
  caption="The Structure Inventory tab in the Consequences module"
/>

While working in the Consequences module, users take these actions:

1. Review the Structure Inventory imported from NSI. Use Index factors and/or edit the Structure Inventory to set a representative base data set of
   population and property values.

1. In the Inundation tab, identify breach locations for a breach prior to overtopping and overtopping. For each breach, set hydrologic inputs and
   breach parameters. Run the HEC-RAS application plug-in to return inundation depths for the leveed area at various loading percentage intervals.

1. In the LifeSim Compute tab, answer emergency preparedness questions from the drop-down menu and run the Life-Sim application plug-in.

1. In the Consequence Results tab, review the consequence estimates and provide a detailed consequences narrative that tells the story of how
   inundation yields losses in the leveed area.

1. In the Critical Infrastructure tab, review the critical infrastructure noted in the leveed area and the inundation characteristics (depth,
   velocity, and arrival time). Determine any local, regional, or national impacts and document in the Critical Infrastructure text field.

For guidance on using the Performance module, see the Performance module chapter (Chapter 6) in this guide.

### Performance module

The Performance module of the LST provides a event-tree based framework for users to evaluate the likelihood of a potential failure mode (PFM) leading
to levee failure.

To reach the Performances module from the Home page:

1. Navigate to the desired levee system within the Levee Screenings page

1. Click the “edit screening” icon of the desired levee segment (or start a new screening).

1. Click Performance in the LST module navigation bar.

Information about a levee segment’s performance is entered into the Performance module of the LST. The Performance module is organized into an upfront
Historical Performance Questions section and a risk compute display with all available performance modes in the LST. Select the check box or the
performance mode name hyperlink to add a performance mode and open the “Performance Metric Editor” window. Each levee segment or floodwall is
evaluated on some or all of the performance modes, depending on the features that are present in the segment. The performance modes are:

- Backward Erosion and Piping in Foundation

- Internal Erosion through Embankment

- Embankment Slope Instability

- Embankment Riverine Erosion

- Closure

- Floodwall Backward Erosion and Piping in Foundation

- Floodwall Instability

- Overtopping Breach

For each of the performance modes, the user will rate the likelihood of an event occurring on a standardized 5-node event tree. A “Description” field
is optional to further clarify the performance mode rated including location, flaw, and/or specific failure process. Users enter justifications for
the rating and add supporting images as necessary. A Performance Metric Editor window for one performance mode is shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-15" />.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-15"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure15.png"
  alt="Performance Metric Editor Window. User selects a rating for each node of a standardized event tree from drop-down boxes."
  caption="Performance Metric Editor Window. User selects a rating for each node of a standardized event tree from drop-down boxes."
/>

While working in the Performance module, users take these actions:

1. Answer the Historical Performance Questions.

1. Add the performance modes that are applicable to the levee segment being assessed.

1. Select and justify ratings in the Performance Metric Editor window.

1. Enter a description, add supporting images, and/or add contributing factors as needed. The contributing factors are a standardized list of
   influential factors commonly associated with the performance mode.

1. To complete the risk compute, users match up the performance modes with applicable loading functions and consequences results using the drop-down
   menus. The drop-down menus are populated by data entered in the preceding Hazard and Consequences modules.

For guidance on using the Performance module, see the Performance module chapter (Chapter 6) in this guide.

## View computations

To reach the Computations module from the Home page:

1. Navigate to the desired levee system within the Levee Screenings page

1. Click the “edit screening” icon of the desired levee segment (or start a new screening).

1. Click Computations in the LST module navigation bar.

The Computations page displays the step-wise numerical computations for the levee risk compute with the following steps:

- Step 1: Performance Modes

- Step 2: Competing Risk Model: Cumulative Incidence Functions (CIF)

- Step 3: APF Using adjusted SRPs

- Step 4: Life Loss

- Step 5a: p(fail) \* Total Life Loss

- Step 5b: Total Expected Annual Life Loss (EALL)

- Step 6a: p(fail) \* Incremental Life Loss

- Step 6b: Incremental Expected Annual Life Loss (EALL)

For guidance on understanding these computations, see the Computations module chapter (Chapter 7) in this guide.

## View results from a levee segment screening

To view the results for a levee segment screening:

1. Navigate to the desired levee system within the Levee Screenings page

1. Click the “edit screening” icon of the desired levee segment (or start a new screening).

1. Click Results in the LST module navigation bar.

The Results module has the following tabs for displaying information:

- Annual Probability: Annual Probability of Breach and Inundation

- Expected Annual: Expected Annual Life Loss

- Levee Risk: Levee (Incremental) Risk Data for Risk Matrix

- Flood Risk: Flood (Total) Risk Data for Risk Matrix

- For guidance on understanding and interpreting the results, see the Results module chapter (Chapter 8) in this guide.

## Major Findings

To view the major findings and understandings for a levee segment screening:

1. Navigate to the desired levee system within the Levee Screenings page

1. Click the “edit screening” icon of the desired levee segment (or start a new screening).

1. Click Major Findings in the LST module navigation bar.

Screening teams will document the overall findings and understandings from the risk assessment in the Major Findings tab. The Major Findings will
include risk-driving inundation scenario, major contributors to probability of breach, findings on the components of risk (hazard, performance,
consequences), and data gaps or uncertainties. Users will enter findings in an open text field box.

## Review

To view the review comments and responses for a levee segment screening:

1. Navigate to the desired levee system within the Levee Screenings page

1. Click the “edit screening” icon of the desired levee segment (or start a new screening).

1. Click Review in the LST module navigation bar.

Review comments from the vertical review process are entered, responded to, and closed out in the Review tab for each levee segment screening. (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-16" />)

<Figure
  figKey="figure-16"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure16.png"
  alt="Review tab documents review comments and responses."
  caption="Review tab documents review comments and responses."
/>

## Generate Reports documents

The LST generates two types of reports:

1. Executive Summary (system-level focus)

1. Risk Assessment Report (segment-level focus)

The reports are intended to be combined for a complete view of levee risk. For multi-segment systems, a levee owner/operator will receive the
executive summary and the segment risk assessment report for only the segment they own/operate.

The report function launches a web-viewer of the report that can be printed to PDF.

The reporting function generates the segment report using information entered into the LST by the user. For example, performance justifications
entered in the LST will also be used in the report to for consumers to understand the rating selections in the LST. Some fields, including the
“Comments” field under “Screening Information” are open text fields that can be used to describe unique considerations or scope of the screening
effort to be captured in the reporting.

Users can generate these reports with the print icons or the “system report” button (<FigReference figKey="figure-10" /> and
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-11" />).

## Screening Status and Submissions

Several pages and tabs indicate a screening’s status. From within a segment screening, a user may select the Status icon (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-17" />). This function returns the user to the Levee System Round page (<FigReference figKey="figure-18" />). To
get to the Levee System Round page from the Home page:

1. Navigate to the desired levee system within the Levee Screenings page via search bar

Finally, the detailed status window can be accessed by selecting the “Ball in Court” icon (<FigReference figKey="figure-19" />). In this window,
status change updates are made by different user types. For example, a facilitator role may submit a screening in this window. An “Incomplete
Screening” warning will return if required actions are incomplete prior to submission.

## System View Screen

The System View screen is a comprehensive summary of the key risk outputs for each segment of the levee system. The screen features a summary table of
numeric results, a system map, and a system risk matrix with the risk estimate of each levee segment (<FigReference figKey="figure-20" />). The
System View screen is used by facilitators and reviewers to understand the system level results and derive conclusions at the system level.

On the System View screen, users can cycle through system results by round both current and former completed rounds. In addition, a hyperlink to the
NLD Risk Tab is provided to view the current recommended actions developed by the USACE and levee owner/operator. Access to this tab in the NLD is
reserved for authorized users only.
