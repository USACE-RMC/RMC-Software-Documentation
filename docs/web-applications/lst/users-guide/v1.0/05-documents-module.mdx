# Documents Module

## Purpose of this module

The purpose of the Documents Module is to view reference documents uploaded to the NLD and provide document storage for supporting information
relevant to the levee screening. User functionality includes viewing, uploading, and re-syncing data sharing from the NLD. The Documents module with
an example of available documentation and organization is viewable in <FigReference figKey="figure-21" />.

## Upload New Supplementary Documents

In addition to viewing documents that are available in the NLD, users may use the “Add New” option to upload any documents that are used as reference
material for the screening effort. Only upload new documents to the LST Document module that are unique to this singular round of the screening
effort. As an example, LST users have historically opted to create optional memorandums summarizing discipline specific work including LST inputs,
data sources and methods. Memorandums of this nature would be acceptable to upload to the screening round documents tab in the LST as opposed to the
NLD.

## National Levee Database & Data Management

The LST Documents module is synced with the NLD. This module will automatically populate with documents that are store in the “Attachments” tab in the
 NLD. Users have ready access to view the NLD documents for the subject segment, which typically include inspection reports among other relevant
documentation. <em>The screening team should be familiar with the latest inspection reports when completing a screening risk assessment.</em>

The NLD is the database of record for levee information and the preferred document storage for its longevity and for external access to documents. For
 USACE internal, ProjectWise is another supported document management system of record housing detailed reports on design, construction, operation &
maintenance manuals, etc. on Federally authorized levee systems. The purpose of the LST Documents Module is not to duplicate this data, but to
supplement.

## Documenting Information Available for the Screening

The LST features a reporting tool that exports relevant information on the input and output from the screening effort. The report includes an appendix
 that will populate with all references shown in this Documents module to display what information was available to the screening team at the time of
the risk assessment.
