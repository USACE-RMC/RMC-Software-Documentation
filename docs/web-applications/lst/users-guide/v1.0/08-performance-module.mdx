# Performance Module

## Performance Module Overview

Dam and levee safety risk analysis requires an estimate of the expected performance, or likelihood of failure, for the full range of load conditions
that the dam or levee may experience. The relationship that describes the expected performance is often called a system response probability (SRP)
curve, or a fragility curve. In reliability theory and in risk analysis, an SRP curve is a cumulative distribution function of capacity. The
probability of failure at a given water surface elevation is the probability that the capacity of the levee is less than the given water surface
elevation. In other words, it is the probability that the levee will fail at some water level less than or equal to the given water surface elevation.

### Event tree analysis to derive System Response Probabilities (SRPs)

System response probabilities can be derived in a variety of ways, but the most common approach in dam and levee safety risk analysis, and the one
applied within this LST 2.0 framework, is through an event tree analysis. Event tree analysis is used to fully describe the sequence of events and/or
conditions necessary to lead to failure. An event tree consists of a sequence of interconnected nodes and branches. Each node is associated with an
uncertain event (e.g. a crack forms in the embankment) or a state of nature (e.g. existence of adversely oriented joint planes). Branches originating from
a node represent each of the possible events or states of nature that can occur. Probabilities are estimated for each branch to represent the
likelihood for each event or condition. These probabilities are conditional on the occurrence of the preceding events to the left in the tree. The
conditional structure of the event tree allows the probability for any sequence of events to be computed by multiplying the probabilities for each
branch along a pathway, in accordance with the multiplication rule of probability theory. SRPs can be developed by completing event trees for
different load levels, or for one load level (e.g. top of levee) and interpolating the remaining response probabilities using an understanding of the
typical shape of the SRP curve for a given potential failure mode (PFM).

### Actions taken in the performance module

Information necessary to estimate the performance of a levee segment when loaded is entered into the Performance module of the LST. The Performance
module includes two main sections: 1) an expandable section where users answer questions about historic performance, and 2) a table where users enter
required data for applicable PFMs. There are seven PFMs available in the LST:

- Backward erosion and piping under the embankment foundation (BEP Foundation)

- Internal erosion through the embankment (IE Embankment)

- Embankment instability

- Embankment riverine erosion

- Closure systems

- Floodwall instability due to backward erosion and piping through foundation (FW Instability BEP Foundation)

- Floodwall instability

- Overtopping

Each of these PFMs has its own section in this chapter that describes the important considerations when filling out the required information.

As the user selects or changes the Hazard Function and Consequence Location for each failure mode, the Annual Probability of Failure (APF) and
Expected Annual Life Loss (EALL) are recomputed and updated accordingly. For more information about computation of the APF and EALL, see the chapter
<em>Computations module</em>.

### Data and information necessary to complete the performance module

The screening assessment team, in coordination with the local sponsor(s), should collect and review all readily available project information.
Supporting project information can include, but is not limited to; recent inspections, design documents, as-built plans, construction records and
photos, past performance history, instrumentation records, and flood fight reports. <em>The assessment team should work with the local sponsor(s) to
ensure that the performance assessment reflects the best available information, which is often held by those who work on the flood damage reduction
project daily.</em>

### Other factors that affect levee performance

The performance of the levee under load will be influenced by the general engineering aspects of the levee segment including, but not limited to, the
geology of the foundation, embankment material, construction methods, how long the water will be present on the levee, past performance under similar
loads, and ability to detect issues as they arise.

## How the Levee Loading and Incident Data is Utilized

The Levee Loading and Incident Database (LLID) is the result of a multi-year effort to collect and categorize historical levee performance data for
levees within USACE jurisdiction. While data collection is still ongoing, the database is robust enough to inform updates to the performance
assessment for LST 2.0.

Specifically, the LLID is used as follows:

1. To understand the factors that contribute to poor performance for each PFM. This information was relied on to develop the guidance in this chapter
   for assessing the potential for failure for each of the PFMs.

1. To define “average” levee performance and the shape of SRP curves for all load levels less than the elicited value at 100%.

1. To help calibrate user ratings throughout the application process, so that portfolio results on expected performance align well with historic
   performance.

A more detailed description of the LLID is provided in Appendix 1. But in short, the LLID is a database containing information on how many times
selected levees in the USACE portfolio have been loaded to different levels, how often they have failed under each of those load levels, and how often
they would have failed without intervention (a.k.a. flood fighting). For those that failed or would have failed, the failure mechanism was assessed
and categorized into one of the PFMs shown in <TableReference tableKey="table-3" />. The factors that led to poor performance were also identified
and are listed in <TableReference tableKey="table-3" /> for each PFM. <em>The understanding of</em> <em>factors that led to poor performance was important
when developing the rating guidance for given PFMs later in this chapter.</em>

The LLID provided important insights as to what drives poor performance when levees are loaded that were not directly considered in the LST 1.0
application. For example, the LLID team quickly identified that old channel/slough crossing locations, previous damage areas, and design/construction
deficiencies were significant determinants of when and where poor performance for Internal Erosion through embankment as well as Backward Erosion and
Piping under the Foundation was more likely to occur. These items have been added to the rating guidance for LST 2.0 on how to assess potential poor
performance.

### System Response Probabilities for the “Average Levee” and Shape Parameters for all Levees

Data contained in the LLID on number of times loaded and number of times breached was used to develop system response probabilities for the full range
of loading for an “average” levee in the LLID. An “average” levee in this context, represents the likelihood that a levee would breach under a given
load when nothing is known about that levee.

Data in the LLID also included engineering judgement whether flood fighting prevented breach for a given event. This information is useful for helping
understand the impacts of flood fighting for different PFMs, and calibrating risk assessment inputs for the Unsuccessful Intervention node (see more
on calibration using LLID later in this section).

The process for developing an “average” SRP curve using data from the LLID is outlined in the steps below using Internal Erosion through the
Embankment (IE Embankment) as an example:

1. Compute the probability of breach, p(breach), for each load interval by dividing the number of times all levees breached (or would have breached)
   by the number of loadings in each load range. Results for Internal Erosion through the embankment are shown in <TableReference tableKey="table-4" />.

### System Response Probabilities for Screened Levees

LST 2.0 applies the following steps to generate systems response probabilities for a given PFM based on user input during the screening process:

1. Users provide ratings for each node in the event tree for a given PFM under full load. The rating options align with the qualitative descriptors of
   likelihood found in <em>USACE and USBR Best Practices in Dam and Levee Safety</em>. The descriptors in LST 2.0 are different than those in LST 1.0
   because the descriptors in LST 1.0 are linked to likelihood ratios, whereas they are conditional probabilities in LST 2.0. For LST 2.0, the options
   are limited as shown in <TableReference tableKey="table-6" />. However, users are allowed to override the defaults and enter any quantitative value
   if it can be justified (which is expected to be rare).

<TableVertical

1. The LST will adjust the “average” curve for a given PFM to fit the elicited probability of failure under full load based on the following
   considerations:

1. The adjusted SRP curve will not display greater dispersion than the base curve on which it is based. In other words, SRPs based on elicited
   user-input should not have more uncertainty than the base (a.k.a. average) SRP.

1. The adjusted SRP curve should not show probabilities greater than zero at or below 0% load level.

1. The adjusted SRP curve should match the elicited probability of failure at 100% loading.

To achieve the considerations above, LST 2.0 does the following where X is the capacity of a levee for a given PFM:

- Consideration a) - assume that the variance of X equals the variance of the base curve (σ<sub>X</sub><sup>2</sup>=σ<sub>Base</sub><sup>2</sup>)

- Consideration b) - assume that X is lognormally distributed

- Consideration c) - assume the cdf of X equals the elicited probability of failure at 100% loading (P<sub>X=1</sub>)

The above means that the distribution parameters of the lognormally distributed variable X should be such that the following two conditions are met:

Condition 1:

:::danger Equation 1 Placeholder
Please replace the following component with your KaTeX-formatted equation:
<Equation
  equationKey="equation-1"
  equation="INSERT EQUATION HERE IN KaTeX FORMAT"
/>
:::

Condition 2:

:::danger Equation 2 Placeholder
Please replace the following component with your KaTeX-formatted equation:
<Equation
  equationKey="equation-2"
  equation="INSERT EQUATION HERE IN KaTeX FORMAT"
/>
:::

From these two expressions, the distribution parameters µ<sub>ln(X) </sub>and σ<sub>ln(X) </sub>can be obtained for any base curve (or any value of
σ<sub>Base</sub>) and any elicited probability at 100% loading.

### Calibrating LST assessments against historic performance

Moving forward, information in the LLID will be used to continuously calibrate user input, refine rating guidance, and inform review activities.
Ultimately, a well-calibrated user base should provide inputs to the LST that, when aggregated across the portfolio, provide results on expected
performance that are similar to what has been observed historically.

After a substantial number of screenings have been completed with LST 2.0, the results will be reviewed at a portfolio level. If expected performance from
those screenings is significantly better or worse than what has been observed historically based on the LLID, guidance in this chapter will be
adjusted accordingly.

## Completing the performance module

### Answer the questions in the Historical Performance section

The Historical Performance section is at the top of the Performance module. To complete the Historical Performance tab, answer each of the four
questions and provide further information in their respective Comments fields. Comment fields must be filled out, and should contain specifics about
what lead to breach or need for flood fighting, the period of record that historical data is available, if any major modifications or remediation
activities that have been made to the levee after failure or flood fighting occurred, etc.

1. For the first four questions, select “yes,” “no,” or “insufficient data,” and provide comments to indicate whether:

1. The levee segment has ever experienced failure due to any PFM prior to overtopping.

1. Flood fighting has ever been used to prevent failure due to any PFM prior to overtopping.

1. The levee has ever experienced an overtopping event.

1. Flood fighting has ever been used to prevent levee overtopping.

1. The Historical Performance tab provides reference information from the Hazard Tab on loading percentage and overtopping. These fields must be
   edited on the Hazard Tab

### Select applicable PFMs

Use the “Applies” column in the PFM table to select those PFMs that apply to the levee segment being screened.

1. If the levee segment includes an earthen embankment, the PFMs of IE Embankment, Embankment Instability, Embankment Riverine Erosion must be
   selected.

1. If the levee segment includes a floodwall, the PFMs of FW Instability and FW BEP Foundation must be selected.

1. If the levee segment includes one or more closure structures, the Closures PFM must be selected.

1. Overtopping must be included for all levee segments.

When a PFM is applied, the Performance Metric Editor will pop up, which allows the user to fill out the require information to estimate likelihood of
failure under full hydraulic load conditions (i.e. water to the top of the levee). Fill out Performance Metric Editor for applicable PFMs.

All PFMs, other than closures, have the same simplified event tree that consists of Initiation, Continuation, Progression, Intervention, and Breach.
Users apply ratings of Unlikely, Neutral, and Likely, which are converted into quantitative probability values of 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 respectively. The
closures PFM has a different event tree, which is described under the Closures section below.

Event trees for each PFM in the LST are described in this chapter, along with the factors to consider when selecting ratings for the
<em>initiation</em>, <em>continuation</em>, <em>unsuccessful intervention</em> and <em>progression</em> nodes. Factors listed for each node are
considered to be the key factors driving the conditional probability of occurrence and informed by the levee incident data. <em>All ratings should be
based on the 100% load condition (water to top of levee) except for overtopping, which should be based on 1’ over overtopping.</em>

When selecting a rating in the LST, users will be required to provide a brief justification for the rating selected.

Users select the Hazard Function that most represents the hazard (i.e. stage-frequency) at the location where each PFM is most likely to occur. The
options available in the Hazard Function dropdown list are based on user entered data in the <em>Hazards module</em>.

Users also select the Consequence Location that most represents the potential consequences of failure for each PFM. The options available in the
Consequence Location dropdown list are based on user entered data in the <em>Consequences module</em>.

As the user selects or changes the Hazard Function and Consequence Location for each PFM, the Annual Probability of Failure (APF) and Expected Annual
Life Loss (EALL) are recomputed and updated accordingly. For more information about computation of APF and EALL, see the chapter <em>Computations
module</em>.

### Seismic Loading Considerations

<em>Seismic hazards and related performance modes are not currently included in the LST 2.0.</em> However, in rare situations, seismic induced failure
could be a risk driver for frequently loaded levees (as defined below). For seismic loading to drive risk, the earthquake would have to occur
coincident with a flood. <em>For a frequently loaded levee/floodwall, if breach or severe damage is expected due to an earthquake, those impacts
should be discussed in the major findings and understandings section.</em>

A frequently loaded levee/floodwall experiences a water surface elevation of 1 foot or higher above the elevation of the landside levee or floodwall
toe for at least once a day for more than 36 days per year on average (10% of the number of days in a year). An intermittently loaded levee/floodwall
does not meet the definition of a frequently loaded levee/floodwall.

Historically, most levees/floodwalls have not been designed or evaluated for seismic loading because of the low probability of an earthquake
coincident with a high impounded water level (i.e., intermittently loaded levee/floodwall). However, levees/floodwalls have experienced damage during
earthquakes. Seismic events can trigger slope instability (e.g., lateral spreading), internal erosion, and overtopping erosion in levees and
instability and overtopping in floodwalls.

When embankments experience a large earthquake, they often settle and spread perpendicular to the centerline and exhibit longitudinal cracking and
some transverse cracking. The same locations for susceptible to cracking under static flood loading apply to seismic loading, but the earthquake
accentuates them by causing additional deformations which occur rapidly. If liquefaction occurs, deformations are likely to be large, and the
likelihood of cracking and overtopping is greater.

Flow slides or post-earthquake slope instability occur when the static driving shear stress is larger than the resisting shear strengths. Lateral
spreading or earthquake-induced deformation involves inertia-driven accumulation of deformation in cases where the static driving shear stress is less
than the resisting shear strengths. Although lateral spreading or earthquake-induced deformation generates less displacement than a flow slide, a
larger deformation may sometimes occur. Additionally, both mechanisms may occur during the same event.

Seismic loading, flow slides, post-earthquake instability, lateral spreading, earthquake-induced deformation, and fault rupture beneath the levee can
damage and adversely impact critical internal seepage control features (such as filters, toe drains, and seepage barrier walls) and adjacent
appurtenant structures (such as pump stations and outlet structures). These often do not result in immediate breach, but if the remnant embankment and
damaged features and appurtenant structures are not repaired before a subsequent flood, the levee/floodwall may be vulnerable to breach at a lower
impounded water level during the subsequent flood.

## Performance mode rating guidance

### General rating philosophy

Recall that each node in the event tree approach is conditional on the preceding node(s) being true. In other words, the assessor should rate each
node with the understanding that the physical processes described in the previous nodes have occurred.

In most cases for screening assessments, ratings for each node should be either Unlikely, Neutral, or Likely unless data and/or analysis is available
to justify other values. The general understanding for each rating is listed below:

- “Likely” – The assessor is reasonably confident that the physical process being considered for this node <em>will </em>occur when the levee is
  loaded to the top (with the understanding the physical processes described in the preceding nodes have already occurred). The LST will assign a
  probability of 0.9 when <em>Likely</em> is selected.

- “Neutral” – The assessor is highly uncertain as to whether the physical process being considered for this node will occur when the levee is loaded
  to the top (with the understanding the physical processes described in the preceding nodes have already occurred). The assessor does not have any
  information to suggest that the process is more likely than not for the load condition being considered. The LST will assign a probability of 0.5 when
  <em>Neutral</em> is selected.

- “Unlikely” – The assessor is reasonably confident that the physical process being considered for this node <em>will not</em> occur when the levee is
  loaded to the top (with the understanding the physical processes described in the preceding nodes have already occurred). The LST will assign a
  probability of 0.1 when <em>Unlikely</em> is selected.

- “Very Unlikely” – Reserved for when assessor is <em>very confident</em> that the physical process being considered for this node <em>will not</em>
  occur when the levee is loaded to the top (with the understanding the physical processes described in the preceding nodes have already occurred). The
  LST will assign a probability of 0.01 when <em>Very Unlikely</em> is selected. Strong justification is required for using this rating. See rating
  guidance under Closure performance mode for special use of this rating.

### Using the “unknown” option

Unknown should only be used when there is no information available that can support the performance assessment. More specifically, the unknown option
should only be selected when information is not available to provide ratings for <em>any</em> node in the event tree for a given PFM. This will be
reserved for when access to the levee is unavailable and no documentation on historic performance, physical condition, and loading characteristics is
available. User will select the “Unknown” checkbox for a PFM, and the LST will apply the “Average” SRP for that performance mode as derived from the
LLID. <em>This should be used with caution as applying an average SRP is a non-conservative approach that may not be appropriate for screening risk
assessments.</em>

Often, even if nothing is known about past performance, geomorphology, construction, or operation and maintenance, the assessor may be able to gather
enough of an understanding of the load duration and potential for flood flighting to inform the continuation and unsuccessful intervention nodes of
the event tree.

If “unknown” is selected for one of the PFMs, it should be selected for all PFMs or justified accordingly.

<strong>Note: </strong>Selecting ratings of neutral for all nodes in an event tree will not result in the same SRP as selecting “unknown” for
performance mode. Selecting neutral for all nodes in an event tree will result in a probability of failure under full load of 0.03125 (computed as
0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5) regardless of the performance mode. (The shape of the SRP curve for each PFM will be slightly different even though they have the
same probability of failure under full load). However, using the unknown option will result in the average SRP for that PFM as shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-57" />.

### Special consideration for the breach node

In most cases for screening, the probability for the breach node should be rated “Likely”, which equals a probability of 1. Generally, the only reason
to select something other than “Likely” would be if you think initiation, continuation, progression and unsuccessful intervention can all occur, but
the flood hydrograph in the river will recede before breach can occur or the influence of tailwater (due to seepage, overtopping, or interior drainage
limitations) would potentially prevent failure.

### The worst location dictates the performance rating

To complete the required information in the performance module, the assessment team selects the worst locations, meaning the location that will lead
to the highest risk in terms of expected annual life loss, along the levee or floodwall segment for a given PFM. <em>The worst location is not always
obvious, as it requires balancing the potential for poor performance and consequences of breach for a given location.</em> Determining the worst
location for a given PFM may require an iterative approach.

The location selected for one PFM will not necessarily be the location selected for another PFM. Thus, one of the first steps undertaken by the
assessment team is to evaluate the entire length of the levee or floodwall segment and select the worst location for each of the PFMs. Ensure each
location has a representative loading scenario (see Hazard module) and consequence estimate (see Consequences module).

### Consideration of past performance

Knowing how a levee has performed during historically under any load events is critical evidence to support ratings of “Likely” or “Unlikely”. If a
levee has performed poorly historically, and remediation measures have not been undertaken, ratings of “Likely” for some (e.g. Initiation at a
minimum) nodes can usually be justified without much additional effort. If documented performance under significant loads, either good or bad, is not
available the guidance below describes considerations for ratings each node.

The assessment team should not rely solely on past performance or lack of physical evidence when completing the performance assessment if the project
has not been hydraulically loaded near the top in its current condition. This is particularly true when considering situations that worsen with time,
such as vegetation growth and deterioration of culverts/discharge pipes that are within the embankment or under floodwalls.

## Backward Erosion Piping in Embankment Foundation (BEP Foundation)

Backward erosion piping (BEP) is an internal erosion failure mode for levees that has historically caused numerous incidents and failures. Based upon
the historical levee performance data across the USACE portfolio, backward erosion piping in embankment foundation, along with internal erosion
through the embankment, has the highest failure rate of all PFMs for loading at the crest of the levee embankment. The most significant contributing
factors to embankment foundation internal erosion are where the levee alignment crosses an old slough/channel location and landside encroachments.
Flood fight measures taken to prevent failure are extremely effective in preventing breach for this PFM significantly reducing the likelihood of
failure.

Sand particles detach at a free, unfiltered surface in which the process gradually works its way towards the waterside of the embankment until a
continuous pipe is formed. <FigReference figKey="figure-58" /> shows how the small erosion channels progress through the foundation sand beneath the
levee and/or clay blanket.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-58"

  alt="Illustration of Backward Erosion Piping (Robbins and O’Leary 2020)"
  caption="Illustration of Backward Erosion Piping (Robbins and O’Leary 2020)"
/>

In the series of graphics in <FigReference figKey="figure-59" />, BEP is depicted to first initiate due to heave/blowout of a top stratum (blanket)
if present (a) causing seepage from the sand substratum (b). Flowing water in the sand substratum can cause migration of sand particles from the sand
substratum, causing it to boil out of the ground, which can result the formation of a void or pipe below the boil (c). If a pipe forms and progresses
through the sand substratum to the impounded water and continues to enlarge from erosion (d), the overlying embankment will eventually collapse
resulting in breach (e through g).

  alt="Backward Erosion Piping Steps (Adapted from van Beek et al. 2011)"
  caption="Backward Erosion Piping Steps (Adapted from van Beek et al. 2011)"
/>

For BEP occur, there must be a flow path/source of water, an unfiltered/unprotected exit from which material can escape, erodible material within the
flow path that can be carried to the exit, and the material being piped or the material directly above it must be able to form and support a
continuous roof or pipe.

<FigReference figKey="figure-60" /> shows the simplified event tree used in LST 2.0 for BEP in the foundation. Considerations when rating each node
for a fully loaded (100% of levee height) flood scenario are described in the following sections.

  alt="Simplified Event Tree for Backward Erosion and Piping in the Foundation"
  caption="Simplified Event Tree for Backward Erosion and Piping in the Foundation"
/>

### BEP Foundation - Initiation

Whether BEP in the foundation will initiate depends on 1) whether a continuous layer of fine-to medium sand exists beneath a roof-forming material; 2)
whether an unfiltered/unprotected exit exists for foundation underseepage; and 3) whether the foundation underseepage leads to heave. All three
events must be considered when assessing factors for initiation.

For vertical exit conditions, heave is a condition when the saturated sand, subjected to upward seepage, suddenly decreases in density and increases
in permeability. The vertical hydraulic gradient at this condition is referred to as a “critical vertical gradient” and describes the hydraulic
gradient resulting in zero effective stress, more commonly envisioned as quick conditions.

Many US river systems are characterized by a semi-pervious top stratum or blanket overlying a more pervious sand aquifer. This configuration results
in excess head in the aquifer landward of the levee, and the excess head dissipated with seepage across the blanket results in gradient-based seepage
forces. If the excess pore pressure causing seepage through the soil exceeds the vertical effective stress that can be developed in the blanket,
heave/blowout occurs rupturing the confining layer and creating an unfiltered exit as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-61" />. This manifests at
the ground surface of the landside levee toe as heavy seepage and sand boils. <TableReference tableKey="table-7" /> provides summarizes influence
factors related to initiation of BEP given the presence of a defect.

The potential for heave/blowout in the field is greatly influenced by geologic details, details of man-made features, climatic conditions, as well as
biological and chemical processes such as excavation by rodents, plugging of seepage exits by biofouling, or mineralization. These defects or
weaknesses can lead directly to an unfiltered exit, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-62" />, and increase the likelihood of heave/blowout.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on BEP Foundation Initiation

1. The primary visual indicators of BEP initiation are heavy seepage with sand boils. Performance history is based on inspection with water near the
   top of the levee (>75% of levee height) and relatively recent such that the potential favorable factors supporting an “Unlikely” rating below are
   likely unchanged since the last significant high-water event. Only pin boils (i.e., throat size less than 0.5-inch in diameter) or low activity boils
   (i.e., no or very little sand observed around throat of sand boil and clear seepage discharge) have occurred.

1. The foundation does not consist of continuous, poorly graded fine to medium sands with a C<sub>u</sub> less than about 3 or 4. The second column in
   <TableReference tableKey="table-7" /> provides other factors that decrease the likelihood of BEP initiation. If a cohesionless soil foundation does
   not exist, input a probability of 1E-06 for the initiation node, describe the foundation conditions in the rationale, and input a probability of 0.5
   (Neutral) for the remaining nodes with no rationale.

1. The levee alignment is not associated with point bar geomorphology and does not cross abandoned channels (including oxbows/sloughs).

1. An underseepage analysis using appropriate geometry, top stratum and pervious substratum parameters, and boundary conditions indicates the factor
   of safety against heave/blowout, based on vertical gradient (FS<sub>vg</sub>) or vertical effective stress (FS<sub>ves</sub>), is greater than or
   equal to 1.6 at the landside levee toe or at any distance from the waterside levee toe (e.g., landside toe of seepage/stability berm). The RMC
   Backward Erosion Piping (Initiation) Toolbox can be used to perform a probabilistic seepage analysis using blanket theory or first-order second-moment
   method of reliability analysis using results from 2D seepage analyses (like Geostudio’s SEEP/W software).

1. No excavation or ditch exists at the landside toe provides a horizontal seepage exit on significantly thins the top stratum (blanket).

1. The thickness of the landside top stratum (blanket) is greater than or equal to the hydraulic head difference from the flood loading, making the
   landside top stratum (blanket) less vulnerable to uplift and cracking, assuming an otherwise intact landside top stratum (blanket) exists.

1. The landside top stratum (blanket) is not penetrated by animal burrows, cracks, encroachments, excavations, trees, power poles, root systems and
   stumps, tree-overthrow pits, previous boils, or other objects.

1. There are no or minimal encroachments, animal burrows, decayed or desiccated roots, large tree-overthrow pits etc. in the foundation, abandoned
   borrow pits that penetrate or significantly thin the top stratum (blanket), scour of the waterside blanket, etc. to significantly shorten the seepage
   pathway.

1. The levee has little or no unwanted vegetation (such as trees, bush, or undesirable weeds), except for vegetation that is properly contained
   and/or situated on overbuilt sections, and the vegetation-free zone from EP 1110-2-18 is maintained.

1. A continuous animal burrow control program exists that includes the elimination of active burrowing and the filling in of existing burrows.

1. Seepage management measures (e.g., berms, toe trains, or relief wells) are adequate, in good condition, and functioning at adequate capacity or
   efficiency.

1. A recent visual or video camera inspection show there are no open joints/defects in the toe drain pipe which is in overall good condition. The
   interior condition of the toe drain pipe has not been recently verified using visual or video camera inspection methods, but the RMC Pipe Service Life
   Toolbox indicates the toe drain pipe is not near the end of service life. Key factors from the toolbox evaluation should be described in the
   rationale.

1. Recent pump testing indicates the SCR is greater than or equal to 80%, decreasing the likelihood of reduced efficiency and need for maintenance
   and rehabilitation.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on initiation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for BEP Foundation to initiate as
Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the foundation characterization (e.g., thickness/integrity of the blanket,
particle-size distribution of the sand substratum, presence of continuous sands susceptible to BEP, etc.), unknown condition of seepage control
features due to a lack of a visual or video camera inspection of toe drains or pump testing of relief wells, lack of seepage analysis, or limited
flood loading history.

### BEP Foundation - Continuation

For BEP to initiate and progress, an unfiltered exit must exist. Therefore, in most cases, the continuation node should be rated “Likely” (to avoid
double-counting with initiation of heave/blowout) unless the exit is into a seepage control feature (such as a toe drain or relief well screen). In
that case, the continuation node should be assessed as described for IE Embankment (Internal Migration).

<FigReference figKey="figure-73" /> shows three types of exit conditions. A planar exit is shown in the top figure, where an open exit is present
naturally (e.g., when no top stratum is present at the landside). A top stratum is present in the middle figure, but a ditch penetrates a substantial
portion of it, leaving a relatively thin cover layer over the foundation sand. In other cases, the exit point is created when the cover layer cracks
or hydraulic fractures locally, as shown in the bottom figure. The top and middle figures generally represent a 2D seepage scenario, whereas the
bottom figure results in a 3D scenario with more converged flow towards the pipe head and towards the pipe in plan as well as from depth. These holes
can result from uplift-induced cracks or natural or manmade penetrations through the cover layer.

  alt="Backward Erosion Piping Exit Conditions (van Beek 2015)"
  caption="Backward Erosion Piping Exit Conditions (van Beek 2015)"
/>

### BEP Foundation – Progression

During BEP progression, the erosion process extends waterside from the point of initiation, forming a pipe (i.e., mechanical condition). There must be
sufficient flow to continuously transport detached particles to the exit and to advance the pipe to the impounded water (i.e., hydraulic condition).
Both events must be considered when assessing factors for initiation. The user can assign probabilities to both events and multiply them together
externally to obtain a single probability for input for this node. If this is done, provide the two probabilities in the rationale.

#### Mechanical Condition

For holding a roof, two primary factors are the presence of continuous harder soil layers (e.g., hardpan or caliche) or embedded structures (e.g.,
pipes/culverts, pump stations, outlet structures, etc.) and the fines content being greater than or equal to 15% regardless of the plasticity of the
fines. Since most levees are homogenous earthfill embankments, the embankment can provide a roof to a developing pipe in the foundation because it is
typically constructed of impervious soils or semi-impervious soils with sufficient fines. Therefore, in most cases, the continuation node should be
rated “Likely”. <FigReference figKey="figure-74" /> is an example of a homogenous embankment that provides a roof to a developing pipe in the
foundation. <TableReference tableKey="table-8" /> provides general guidance to assess the likelihood of a soil’s ability to hold a roof to a pipe as
a function of soil classification, fines content, plasticity of fines, and moisture condition.

#### Hydraulic Condition

Once erosion initiates, the pipe may progress horizontally through the foundation in the direction towards the impounded water if horizontal hydraulic
gradients in the foundation are sufficiently high. They must remain high near the waterside tip of the progressing pipe for particles to continue
eroding.

The hydraulic condition for BEP progression is illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-75" />a includes 1) liquefaction or fluidization at the
pipe head due to concentrated flow leading to 2) occasional bursts of high suspension solids into the pipe and 3) laminar flow conditions in an open
pipe which cause 4) sediment transport along the bottom of the pipe. In general, there must be sufficient flow to continuously transport detached soil
particles to an exit and to advance the pipe to the river or reservoir.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-75"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure75.png"
  alt="Hydraulic Condition for BEP Progression (a. van Beek 2015, b. van Beek et al. 2010)."
  caption="Hydraulic Condition for BEP Progression (a. van Beek 2015, b. van Beek et al. 2010)."
/>

Progression of the pipe can stop if the horizontal hydraulic gradient is lower than the critical horizontal gradient, as illustrated in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-75" />b. This can occur due to the short duration for a critical hydraulic head difference or by a reduction of the
hydraulic head difference by raising the tailwater through an intervention action such as constructing sandbag rings around a seepage exit. However,
subsequent (possibly even lesser) flood events may have a shorter seepage path due to previous piping and thus require a lower hydraulic head
difference to initiate and progress to breach.

Backward erosion piping can progress with horizontal hydraulic gradients (H/L) as low as 0.05 in fine to medium uniform sands, which is the inverse of
Bligh’s creep ratio for fine sand. Robbins and O’Leary (2020) developed probabilistic charts of horizontal gradients corrected for scale, soil
density, and anisotropy to apply to <em>deep, pervious aquifers only</em> for the geometry illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-76" /> of a
typical levee. <FigReference figKey="figure-77" /> and <FigReference figKey="figure-78" /> can be used to estimate field-scale probabilities for BEP
progression for seepage path lengths (L) of 500 feet and 1,000 feet, respectively, for dense sands (D<sub>r</sub>=60%) and loose sands
(D<sub>r</sub>=30%). <FigReference figKey="figure-78" /> provides a reasonable upper bound for most applications, and intermediate seepage lengths
can be estimated by interpolating between <FigReference figKey="figure-77" /> and <FigReference figKey="figure-78" />. For seepage path lengths
greater than 1,000 feet, the charts may become unconservative as the length exceeds the scale the charts were developed for.

If site factors are significantly different from those assumed to develop these charts, a more refined, site-specific analysis should be performed.
For a more detailed evaluation, the RMC Backward Erosion Piping (Progression) Toolbox can be used to estimate the likelihood of BEP progression.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Progression

1. Mechanical Condition: Continuous harder soil layers (e.g., hardpan or caliche) form the roof of the pipe/crack. <FigReference figKey="figure-79" />
   shows the hardpan layers in the overhang that formed the roof at A.V. Watkins Dam in Utah.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-79"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure79.png"
  alt="Example of Hardpan Roof."
  caption="Example of Hardpan Roof."
/>

1. Mechanical Condition: Continuous embedded structures (e.g., pipes/culverts, pump stations, outlet structures, etc.) form the roof of the
   pipe/crack.

1. Mechanical Condition: The roof of the pipe will not collapse. In general, if the fines content is greater than or equal to 15%, the soil will hold
   a roof, regardless of the plasticity of the fines. <TableReference tableKey="table-8" /> provides general guidance to assess the likelihood of a
   soil’s ability to hold a roof.

1. Hydraulic Condition: No seepage barrier wall exists.

1. Hydraulic Condition: Sufficient flow (horizontal gradient) and flood duration exist to advance pipe from the landside to the impounded water.
   Backward erosion piping can progress with horizontal hydraulic gradients as low as 0.05 in fine to medium uniform sands. <em>For deep, pervious
   aquifers only</em>, <FigReference figKey="figure-77" /> and <FigReference figKey="figure-78" /> can be used to estimate field-scale probabilities
   for BEP progression as a function of coefficient of uniformity, relative density, and horizontal hydraulic gradient. [Note: Critical horizontal
   gradients for 3D exit configurations with flow towards a single point (e.g., hole in a confining layer) are approximately 50% those predicted by 2D
   models for ditch and planar exit conditions.]

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Progression

1. Mechanical Condition: The roof of the pipe will collapse. <TableReference tableKey="table-8" /> provides general guidance to assess the likelihood
   of a soil’s ability to hold a roof. Non-plastic silts, sands, and gravels will generally not hold a roof since the roof collapses upon saturation.
   Partially saturated and high fines content non-plastic soils may hold a roof near the phreatic surface, but the roof is sustained by pore pressure
   suction and may collapse upon saturation. Some secondary factors to consider are as follows: moist soils are more likely to collapse upon saturation
   than saturated soils; loose soils are less likely to hold a roof than dense soils; and cyclic reservoir levels are more likely to cause roof collapse
   than steady reservoir levels.

1. Hydraulic Condition: A seepage barrier wall exists that fully or partially penetrates the pervious foundation. When a vertical structure is present
   in the path of the pipe, the sand downstream of the structure must fluidize before the pipe can pass. <FigReference figKey="figure-80" /> shows how
   the presence of a vertical seepage path causes large resistance for pipe development. If an open defect exists in the seepage barrier, it must align
   with the fine-to-medium uniform sand layer and roof-forming material, but even then, the size of the open defect will limit flows to the developing
   pipe and thus progression. [Note: Critical horizontal gradients for 3D exit configurations with flow towards a single point (e.g., hole in a confining
   layer) are approximately 50% those predicted by 2D models for ditch and planar exit conditions.]

  alt="Influence of Seepage Barrier Penetration Depth on Critical Horizontal Gradient (Bonelli 2013)."
  caption="Influence of Seepage Barrier Penetration Depth on Critical Horizontal Gradient (Bonelli 2013)."
/>

1. Hydraulic Condition: The fine to medium sand has a fines content (FC) of 5% or more. <FigReference figKey="figure-81" /> shows the significant
   influence of FC on critical horizontal gradient for BEP progression. At a FC of 5%, the critical horizonal gradient is doubled, and at a FC of 10%,
   the critical horizonal gradient is quadrupled.

1. Hydraulic Condition: Sufficient flow (horizontal gradient) and flood duration do not exist to advance pipe from the landside to the impounded
   water. Horizontal hydraulic gradients are 0.02 or less in fine to medium uniform sands. <em>For deep, pervious aquifers only</em>,
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-77" /> and <FigReference figKey="figure-78" /> can be used to estimate field-scale probabilities for BEP
   progression as a function of coefficient of uniformity, relative density, and horizontal hydraulic gradient. [Note: Critical horizontal gradients for
   3D exit configurations with flow towards a single point (e.g., hole in a confining layer) are approximately 50% those predicted by 2D models for ditch
   and planar exit conditions.]

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Progression

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for BEP Foundation to progress as
Likely or Unlikely. This is typically due to uncertainty with the embankment characterization for roofing or foundation characterization and critical
horizontal gradient for BEP progression.

### BEP Foundation - Unsuccessful Intervention

Unsuccessful intervention considers the likelihood that human efforts to detect and stop (or slow) the internal erosion process from breaching the
embankment fail to work. Both events must be considered when assessing factors for unsuccessful intervention.

Detection considers whether or when the developing failure mode would be observed and recognized as a problem. Seepage must be observable to be
detectable, and vegetation or encroachments can obscure seepage containing eroded foundation particles at the landside toe. Having adequate monitoring
plans in the operation and maintenance manual is a key consideration for detection.

The ability to successfully intervene depends on whether mitigating efforts can be implemented in time to stop (or slow) the internal erosion process
to the point where breach does not occur. Given the seepage is observable and detectable, the likelihood of successful intervention depends on several
factors including the time available to intervene based on the rate of erosion; the accessibility of the project and the seepage entrance or exit;
and the availability of personnel, equipment, and materials. The size of the flood event is also important. Large events can have regional impacts
which can limit the availability of personnel since they may be spread out of several projects. Having adequate flood-fighting protocols in the
operation and maintenance manual is a key consideration for intervention and repair.

Flood fighting is extremely effective in preventing breach for this PFM. There have been over 300 documented incidents where flood fight measures
prevented the levee embankment from breaching due to BEP Foundation. It is not clear in most of these incidents at exactly what point in time (path
along the event tree) that actions were taken to prevent the breach from potentially occurring. Assuming there is adequate time, experience, personnel
and materials, historical performance data suggests flood fighting can significantly reduce the likelihood of failure associated with this PFM.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on BEP Foundation Unsuccessful Intervention

A Likely rating for unsuccessful intervention is a <em>negative</em> rating, meaning the assessor does not think intervention will be successful.
Examples of when a Likely rating would be appropriate include:

1. Intervention has been attempted and failed in the past, and emergency preparedness (e.g., planning, necessary personnel and materials, etc.) has
   not improved.

1. The emergence of seepage is obscured by tailwater, marsh areas, dense vegetation, blankets, encroachments, etc. and/or the frequency of inspections
   is inadequate such that detection is unlikely. If the seepage cannot be detected, intervention cannot occur. <FigReference figKey="figure-82" /> is
   an example of vegetation that would warrant a Likely rating for unsuccessful intervention.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-82"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure82.png"
  alt="Dense Vegetation Obscuring Landside Toe."
  caption="Dense Vegetation Obscuring Landside Toe."
/>

1. Heroic intervention such as a construction of a seepage berm is required, but this action is a last resort during a fully loaded (100% of levee
   height) flood scenario.

1. The distance from the seepage exit to the impounded water is very short based on a narrow crown and no seepage berm, encroachments in the
   foundation, abandoned borrow pits, scour of the waterside blanket, etc. and/or the flood duration is very long.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on BEP Foundation Unsuccessful Intervention

An Unlikely rating for unsuccessful intervention is a <em>positive</em> rating that will significantly reduce the probability of breach, meaning the
assessor believes that intervention (i.e., flood fighting) will be successful.

1. Intervention has successfully prevented breach in the past for this performance mode, and emergency preparedness has not changed significantly
   since that experience (e.g., experienced owner/operator, personnel and materials are still available, etc.). [Note: If intervention was required for
   water levels less than full load, the potential for multiple locations requiring intervention under future loads should be considered and may still
   warrant a Likely or Neutral rating even if past intervention has been successful.]

1. Flood-fighting protocols are documented in the operation and maintenance manual. Emergence of seepage is not obscured by tailwater, marsh areas,
   dense vegetation, blankets, encroachments, etc. and the frequency of inspections is adequate such that detection is likely. [Note: If flood fighting
   is planned as part of the original levee design, protocols and the ability to detect the seepage and access the site are still necessary for an
   Unlikely rating.] [Note: An Unlikely rating may still be appropriate in this situation if there are obstructions present on the landside slope that
   are not easily removed.]

1. The distance from the seepage exit to the impounded water is very long based on a very wide crown (such as multi-lane highway) and/or seepage berm,
   and/or the flood duration is very short. No encroachments in the foundation, abandoned borrow pits, scour of the waterside blanket, etc. shorten the
   seepage pathway.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on BEP Foundation Unsuccessful Intervention

A Neutral rating should be applied when the assessor is highly uncertain about the maintaining agency’s ability to identify issues during an event and
intervene prior to breach. Examples of when a Neutral rating is appropriate include:

1. The maintaining agency has not attempted intervention in the past, but they have plans and materials in place to attempt intervention. However, the
   distance from the seepage exit to the impounded water is very short based on a narrow crown and no seepage berm, and/or the flood duration is very
   long such that there may be insufficient time to detect the seepage and successfully intervene.

1. Access to the landside toe where sand boils are likely to occur is limited. <FigReference figKey="figure-83" /> is an example where several large,
   bulky items have been placed near the levee toe, preventing quick access during a high-water event for inspection and flood fighting.

## Internal Erosion Through Embankment (IE Embankment)

Internal erosion through embankment, along with backward erosion piping in the foundation, are the leading causes of levee embankment failures when
loaded near the levee crest. There has been numerous documented internal erosion through embankment failures across the USACE portfolio. The leading
contributor to distress associated with this PFM is culverts/pipes through the embankment, Flood fighting is extremely effective in preventing breach
of the levee due to this PFM from occurring.

For screening purposes, internal erosion through the embankment is separated into two processes: Concentrated Leak Erosion (CLE) or Internal Migration
(IM). The assessor must pick the appropriate physical process in the LST interface, based on their understanding of which process is most likely to
occur. Use the event tree and enter appropriate ratings for the sub-process that drives the risk. <em>Do not mix inputs for nodes between the two
processes.</em>

Concentrated leak erosion should be selected when the internal erosion is associated with transverse cracks or gaps in the embankment or adjacent to
embedded structures or features. Internal migration should be selected when the condition of embedded pipes/culverts has deteriorated enough to
provide an open defect for erosion of the overlying embankment materials into the open defect.

### IE Embankment - Concentrated Leak Erosion (CLE)

Concentrated leak erosion is a form of scour that refers to an internal erosion process involving leakage flow through an opening in the soil mass
(such as cracks in the embankment). Cracking occurs in soil when the tensile stresses in the soil exceed its tensile strength capacity. Leakage flow
through the crack applies hydraulic shear stresses (or tractive forces) onto the walls of the crack, and this can lead to particle detachment from the
walls of the crack. <FigReference figKey="figure-84" /> illustrates the process for a continuous crack through a homogeneous earth embankment.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-84"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure84.png"
  alt="Mechanism of Soil Particle Detachment and Transport in Concentrated Leak Erosion (Fell et al. 2015)."
  caption="Mechanism of Soil Particle Detachment and Transport in Concentrated Leak Erosion (Fell et al. 2015)."
/>

Hydraulic fracture involves the formation and extension of an opening in a soil mass due to increasing water pressure. In
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-85" />, an initial opening forms on the upstream side of the embankment due to a crack. The water pressure in the
initial water-filled crack increases (e.g., due to an increase in impounded water level). If the water pressure in the crack exceeds the sum of the
minor principal stress and tensile capacity of the soil at the crack tip, the crack is jacked open, and it extends further into the embankment. The
process progresses from waterside to landside. Hydraulic fracturing of the embankment can also occur due to the use of high pressures when drilling
with water or air, or by pressure grouting.

  alt="Mechanism of Formation of Hydraulic Fractures (Fell et al. 2015)."
  caption="Mechanism of Formation of Hydraulic Fractures (Fell et al. 2015)."
/>

<FigReference figKey="figure-86" /> shows the simplified event tree used in LST 2.0 for concentrated leak erosion. Considerations when rating each
node for a fully loaded (100% of levee height) flood scenario are described in the following sections.

<Figure

  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure86.png"
  alt="Simplified Event Tree for Concentrated Leak Erosion in the Embankment."
  caption="Simplified Event Tree for Concentrated Leak Erosion in the Embankment."
/>

### IE Embankment (CLE) - Initiation

Whether erosion will initiate in concentrated leaks in an embankment depends on 1) whether a continuous crack exists; and 2) whether the forces
imposed on the sides of the crack by the water flowing through the crack are sufficient to initiate erosion with sufficient flow velocity to transport
the detached particles in the crack. Both events must be considered when assessing factors for initiation.

There are a wide range of mechanisms that can create cracks through which concentrated leaks can develop. Many of these are related to differential
settlement, poorly compacted zones, and embedded structures or features.

<TableReference tableKey="table-9" /> provides general guidance to assess the likelihood of concentrated leak erosion initiation for a range of crack
widths and average hydraulic gradients for flow in the crack as a function of soil classification. Concentrated leak erosion may be likely to occur in
highly erodible soils such as silts, silty sands, or dispersive clays at crack widths of 0.25 to 0.5 inch under a hydraulic gradient as low as 0.1,
or crack widths as small as 1 or 2 mm under hydraulic gradients of 0.5 or more. Clays may not be likely to erode until cracks reach 1 or 2 inches in
width and hydraulic gradients approach 0.5 or more.

For a more detailed evaluation, the RMC Concentrated Leak Erosion (Initiation) Toolbox can be used to calculate the hydraulic shear stress in the
crack or pipe for the selected crack geometry, with crack width and depth informed by the RMC Concentrated Leak Erosion (Cracking) Toolbox, and
compare it to the estimated critical shear stress using the RMC Erodibility Parameters Toolbox.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Initiation

1. The primary visual indicators of CLE initiation are cracks and concentrated leaks as described below. Performance history is based on inspection
   with water near the top of the levee (>75% of levee height) and relatively recent such that the potential adverse factors supporting a “Likely” rating
   below are likely unchanged since the last significant high-water event.

1. Transverse cracks exist on the crown and extend from waterside to landside (i.e., continuous pathway for concentrated leaks) as shown in
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-87" />. [Note: Pavement or other surface cover can obscure cracking.]

<Figure
  figKey="figure-87"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure87.png"
  alt="Example of Transverse Cracking on the Levee Crown."
  caption="Example of Transverse Cracking on the Levee Crown."
/>

1. Extensive, open longitudinal cracks exist on the crown that may interconnect and thus extend from waterside to landside (i.e., continuous pathway
   for concentrated leaks). [Note: Pavement or other surface cover can obscure cracking.] Longitudinal cracking is more common in zoned embankments
   where more compressible outer shell zones can cause a “down drag” effect on a stiff central core zone. However, zoned embankments are rare for levees.
   Longitudinal cracking can also be associated with slope instability. Federally constructed levees usually have slopes of about 3H:1V or flatter. Many
   non-federally constructed levees and some federally constructed levees have steeper slopes. Levees with steep slopes and a narrow crown width are
   more likely to have intersecting longitudinal cracks.

1. Concentrated leaks were observed on the landside slope face during previous flood loadings. <FigReference figKey="figure-88" /> is an example of
   concentrated leaks emerging on the downstream slope of Turnbridge Dam in Tasmania, Australia.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-88"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure88.png"
  alt="Example of Concentrated Leakage (Fell et al. 2008)."
  caption="Example of Concentrated Leakage (Fell et al. 2008)."
/>

1. The embankment contains dispersive soils that are very susceptible to transverse cracking and vulnerable to concentrated leak erosion under very
   low hydraulic shear stresses and hydraulic gradients because of their clay mineralogy and water chemistry. If the embankment characterization is
   uncertain, characteristic surface erosion patterns include vertical shafts with widened rounded voids at the shaft bottom knows as jugs because of
   their shape. Water flows along horizontal planes and forms tunnels like animal burrows. Deep rills dropping into jugs may form on the crown and
   slopes. Tunnels and jugs can form an interconnected network. <FigReference figKey="figure-89" /> are examples of erosional features associated with
   dispersive soils on the Reach 11 dikes on the Central Arizona Project.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-89"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure89.png"
  alt="Examples of Surface Erosion of Dispersive Soils (FEMA 2015)."
  caption="Examples of Surface Erosion of Dispersive Soils (FEMA 2015)."
/>

1. Cone penetration tests or continuous sampling indicate soft or loose zones in the embankment in a continuous zone from waterside to landside.

1. Settlement during construction is greater than approximately 3% to 5% of the embankment height, and/or post-construction settlement is greater than
   approximately 1% to 2% of the embankment height. Based on case history data, embankments with large settlements are likely to be susceptible to
   transverse cracking and hydraulic fracture.

1. Foundation conditions and profile are favorable for differential settlement leading to cracking, lateral strains, and low-stress zones subject to
   hydraulic fracture. <FigReference figKey="figure-90" /> shows typical scenarios which can lead to differential settlement. At the top, differential
   foundation support conditions across the profile include soil and rock (or a relatively incompressible layer). In the middle, a very compressible soil
   of limited areal extent is present in the soil foundation. At the bottom, differential settlement occurs over the pipe/culvert excavation backfill.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-90"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure90.png"
  alt="Typical Scenarios for Differential Settlement in the Foundation (adapted from Fell et al. 2008)."
  caption="Typical Scenarios for Differential Settlement in the Foundation (adapted from Fell et al. 2008)."
/>

1. An embedded pump station, floodwall, roadway, bridge, or control structure traverses the embankment. Cracking or a gap may form adjacent to these
   features as the earthfill settles away from the feature during and after construction. <FigReference figKey="figure-91" /> shows examples with
   increased likelihood of a crack or gap forming between the earthfill and adjacent wall. Deformations of flexible or under-designed retaining walls
   (such as those designed for active instead of at-rest earth pressure) can also lead to cracks or gaps.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-91"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure91.png"
  alt="Example of Gap between Embankment and Embedded Features (adapted from Fell et al. 2004)."
  caption="Example of Gap between Embankment and Embedded Features (adapted from Fell et al. 2004)."
/>

1. An embedded pipe/culvert traverses the embankment. Many failures and incidents have occurred at pipes/culverts embedded in the embankment.
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-92" /> shows examples of poor practice leading to high-permeability zones in the embankment adjacent to
   pipes/culverts. Hydraulic fracturing can occur due to stress distributions resulting from the stiff pipe/culvert and its less stiff surrounding soil
   and low principal stresses. Hydraulic fracturing can also occur on the sides of pipes/culverts constructed in trenches and where sharp corners are
   present in any concrete or concrete-surround. Desiccation cracking can occur in the sides of the pipe/culvert excavation during construction. Poor
   compaction can occur due to closely spaced collars or concrete formed with a corrugated steel sheet or other non-smooth formwork, as well as at narrow
   spaces adjacent to the pipe/culvert. Poor compaction is likely to lead to collapse settlement of the soil on saturation forming a gap adjacent to the
   pipe/culvert.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-92"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure92.png"

  caption="Some Causes of Concentrated Leak Erosion around Pipes/Culverts (Fell et al. 2008)."
/>

1. Embankment materials are susceptible to hydraulic fracture. Highly compacted soils, soils compacted at low water contents and soils with low
   plasticity are more likely to develop significant tension zones from differential settlement in susceptible foundation conditions and profiles than
   flexible soils. Where differential settlement and corresponding low lateral stresses in the overlying embankment occur, hydraulic fracturing can
   occur.

1. Use of high pressures when drilling with water or air, or by pressure grouting can hydraulically fracture the embankment.

1. A continuous layer of low-density or high-permeability material due to poor compaction exists in the embankment. Construction quality control
   documentation shows the cohesive embankment material was compacted to less than 95% to 98% of the standard Proctor maximum dry density at more than 2%
   dry of optimum moisture content, or cohesionless embankment materials were compacted to less than 65% relative density. Absent quality control data,
   embankments placed with no formal compaction, compacted by dozer or “equipment travel,” or without the use of rollers, in lift thicknesses greater
   than 12 to 18 inches after compaction (i.e., at or beyond the limit of the compaction equipment used), or with no control on layer thickness are more
   likely to have poorly compacted zones.

1. Desiccation cracking exists at the crown. <FigReference figKey="figure-93" /> is an example of desiccation cracking. Desiccation cracking is more
   likely to be an issue in climates with less than 10 inches of annual rainfall, in medium to high plasticity (LL>40) embankment materials, and where
   there is no asphalt or concrete pavement or less than 3 inches granular base layer (without pavement) overlying the embankment materials. Desiccated
   layers on seasonal shutdown or staged construction surfaces, if applicable, or soil exposed to drying during construction were not undercut and
   replaced or not scarified and moisture conditioned. Desiccation cracking may interconnect and thus extend from waterside to landside (i.e., continuous
   pathway for concentrated leaks).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-93"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure93.png"
  alt="Example of Desiccation Cracking."
  caption="Example of Desiccation Cracking."
/>

1. The crown is damaged by frost. The effects of frost and thaw shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-94" /> are more likely to occur in sub-arctic
   or alpine climates where temperatures remain below freezing for 1 to 3 months or more in silts, clayey silts, silty sands, silty gravels, and clayey
   sands and gravels with PI &lt 12 that are susceptible to freezing and ice lens formation. Extra water can be drawn into the soil by capillary action
   causing pumping and ice lenses leading to heave and cracking/loosening (i.e., a high-permeability layer). Frozen layers on seasonal shutdown or staged
   construction surfaces, if applicable, were not undercut and replaced or not scarified and moisture conditioned. The cracking and loosened zone may
   interconnect and thus extend from waterside to landside (i.e., continuous pathway for concentrated leaks).

  alt="Effects of Frost and Thaw (Vuola et al. 2007)."
  caption="Effects of Frost and Thaw (Vuola et al. 2007)."
/>

1. Encroachments, animal burrows, decayed or desiccated roots, large tree-overthrow pits, etc. exist in the embankment that significantly shorten the
   leakage pathway.

1. A section of the levee is removed without a supporting engineering analysis or recent past performance. <FigReference figKey="figure-95" /> is
   an example of an encroachment, where a portion of the levee was removed to construct an addition to a house. The amount of material removed
   significantly reduces the effective width of the levee for concentrated leaks.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-95"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure95.png"
  alt="Example of House Addition Built into the Levee."
  caption="Example of House Addition Built into the Levee."
/>

1. Significant vegetation growth (such as brush, weeds, or any trees greater than 2 inches in diameter) is present within the vegetation-free zone from
   EP 1110-2-18.

1. Animal burrow control program is not effective or is nonexistent. <FigReference figKey="figure-96" /> shows nearly continuous animal burrows
   through an embankment with dangerously high hydraulic gradients because of the shortened effective width of the levee. Waterside burrows can also
   allow the water level to extend into the dam embankment, forcing the phreatic surface further into the embankment, and landside burrows can provide a
   shorter distance for a concentrated leak to exit.

  alt="Shortened Leakage Path from Burrows (FEMA 2005b)."
  caption="Shortened Leakage Path from Burrows (FEMA 2005b)."
/>

1. Sufficient hydraulic shear stress exists for concentrated leak erosion initiation. <TableReference tableKey="table-9" /> provides general guidance
   to assess the likelihood of CLE initiation for a range of defect widths and hydraulic gradients of flow in the defect as a function of soil
   classification.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Initiation

1. The primary visual indicators of CLE initiation are cracks and concentrated leaks as described below. Performance history is based on inspection
   with water near the top of the levee (>75% of levee height) and relatively recent such that the potential favorable factors supporting an “Unlikely”
   rating below are likely unchanged since the last significant high-water event.

1. Transverse cracking does not exist on the crown. [Note: Pavement or other surface cover can obscure cracking.]

1. Extensive, open longitudinal cracks do not exist on the crown. [Note: Pavement or other surface cover can obscure cracking.]

1. Concentrated leaks were not observed on the landside slope face during previous flood loadings.

1. Cone penetration tests or continuous sampling do not indicate loose or soft zones in the embankment, or such zones are isolated or discontinuous from
   waterside to landside.

1. Settlement during construction is less than approximately 1% of the embankment height, and/or post-construction settlement is less than
   approximately 0.25% of the embankment height. Based on case history data, embankments with small settlements are less likely to be susceptible to
   transverse cracking and hydraulic fracture.

1. Foundation conditions and profile are not favorable for differential settlement (i.e., relatively non-compressible or uniform).

1. No embedded pump stations, outlet structures, floodwalls, roadways, bridges, or control structures traverse the embankment.

1. No embedded pipes/culverts traverse the embankment.

1. Embankment materials are not susceptible to hydraulic fracture. Soils with higher plasticity are more compressible and flexible than lower PI
   soils, and soils placed at lower dry densities and wet of optimum water content are more flexible. Both characteristics are less likely for to
   hydraulic fracture.

1. A continuous layer of low-density or high-permeability material does not exist in the embankment. Construction quality control documentation shows
   the cohesive embankment material was compacted to more than 95% to 98% of the standard Proctor maximum dry density around optimum moisture content
   (±2%), or cohesionless embankment materials were compacted to more than 85% relative density. Absent quality control data, embankments placed with
   formal compaction using rollers in lift thicknesses of 6 to 8 inches after compaction are less likely to have poorly compacted zones.

1. The embankment soils and climate are not susceptible to desiccation cracking. Desiccation cracking is less likely to be an issue in areas with an
   average net evaporation rate (E<sub>r</sub>), calculated as average annual pan evaporation (E<sub>p</sub>) minus average annual rainfall (R), is less
   than 450 mm (18 inches) and in non-plastic or low plasticity (LL &lt 20) embankment materials. Desiccation cracking is seldom present beneath sealed and
   gravel roads. Desiccated layers on seasonal shutdown or staged construction surfaces, if applicable, or soil exposed to drying during construction
   were undercut and replaced or scarified and moisture conditioned.

1. The embankment soils and climate are not susceptible to the effects of frost and thaw. The climate is such that temperatures do not fall below the
   freezing point except possibly overnight or for a few days. For sub-arctic or alpine climates, the embankment consists of clean gravel (GP, GW) and
   sand (SP, SW) with less than 3% clayey fines (&lt 0.02 mm). Frozen layers on seasonal shutdown or staged construction surfaces, if applicable, were not
   undercut and replaced or not scarified and moisture conditioned.

1. There are no or minimal encroachments, animal burrows, decayed or desiccated roots, tree-overthrow pits etc. in the embankment to significantly
   shorten the leakage pathway.

1. The levee has little or no unwanted vegetation (such as trees, bush, or undesirable weeds), except for vegetation that is properly contained
   and/or situated on overbuilt sections, and the vegetation-free zone from EP 1110-2-18 is maintained.

1. A continuous animal burrow control program exists that includes the elimination of active burrowing and the filling in of existing burrows.

1. Sufficient hydraulic shear stress does not exist for concentrated leak erosion initiation. <TableReference tableKey="table-9" /> provides general
   guidance to assess the likelihood of CLE initiation for a range of defect widths and hydraulic gradients of flow in the defect as a function of soil
   classification.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Initiation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for IE Embankment (CLE) to
initiate as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the embankment’s susceptibility to cracking or the presence of cracks
and concentrated leaks because of inability to inspect, lack of inspection data, or limited flood loading history above the level of expected
cracking.

### IE Embankment (CLE) - Continuation

Once erosion is initiated, it will continue unless the eroding forces are reduced or the passage of the eroded particles is impeded in some way. Thus,
erosion may be interrupted or arrested by filtering action in landside materials in the embankment. <FigReference figKey="figure-97" /> depicts how
filters are designed to prevent particle movement from intergranular seepage flow.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-97"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure97.png"
  alt="Schematic of Filtering Action (FEMA 2005)."
  caption="Schematic of Filtering Action (FEMA 2005)."
/>

<Citation citationKey="Foster2001" /> conducted research to determine the particle size of the filter material relative to the base material it is
protecting. <FigReference figKey="figure-98" /> shows how filter performance is characterized by how much erosion occurs to seal the filter using the
following terms:

- No erosion: Filter seals with practically no erosion of the base material.

- Some erosion: Filter seals after some erosion of the base material.

- Excessive erosion: Filter seals but after excessive erosion of the base soil.

- Continuing erosion: Filter is too coarse to allow the eroded base materials to seal.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-98"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure98.png"
  alt="Erosion Conditions (Foster 2012)."
  caption="Erosion Conditions (Foster 2012)."
/>

<FigReference figKey="figure-99" /> conceptually shows the boundaries of the filter test behavior. The particle-size diameter of the filter material
corresponding to 15% passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve (D<sub>15</sub>F) increases with higher amounts of erosion. If a
filter is present and particle-size data is available to characterize the embankment and filter materials, the RMC Filter Evaluation (Continuation)
Toolbox can be used to assess the particle retention and permeability criteria for filter materials.

  alt="Conceptual Filter Erosion Boundaries (adapted from Foster and Fell 2001)."
  caption="Conceptual Filter Erosion Boundaries (adapted from Foster and Fell 2001)."
/>

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Continuation

1. No zone of material exists on the landside slope that would serve as a filter for the base material. <em>This is usually the case for levee
   embankments as m</em>ost levees are homogeneous embankments without filters.

1. A zone of filter material exists on the landside slope, but a particle retention analysis indicates excessive or continuing erosion conditions
   exists for the base material.

1. The filter contains more than 5% fines, plastic fines, or crushed rock, or carbonate rock (such as limestone, marble, and dolomite) or sulfides
   that are susceptible to cementation. Denser filters are also more likely to hold a crack.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Continuation

1. A zone of filter material exists on the landside slope, and a particle retention analysis indicates some erosion condition exists for the base
   material.

1. The filter contains less than 5% fines, non-plastic fines, and/or rock of natural origins. Loose and lightly compacted filters are less likely to
   hold a crack.

#### Factors that support “Very Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Continuation

1. A zone of filter material exists on the landside slope, and a particle retention analysis indicates the filter meets modern filter design criteria
   for the base material (i.e., no erosion condition).

1. The filter contains less than 5% fines, non-plastic fines, and/or rock of natural origins. Loose and lightly compacted filters are also less likely
   to hold a crack.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Continuation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for IE Embankment (CLE) to
continue as Likely or Unlikely when a filter material is present. This is most likely due to uncertainty with the characterization of the base
material and filter material for particle retention (i.e., lack of particle-size distribution data).

### IE Embankment (CLE) - Progression

During progression, erosion in a crack leads to the development of a pipe. Once initiated and not arrested by filter action, concentrated leak erosion
will progress under mechanical and hydraulic conditions. Absent crack-filling, clogging, and flow limitation, or lowering of the water level to
reduce the hydraulic gradient, erosion will progress because hydraulic shear stresses in the pipe or crack increase as the pipe or crack enlarges. All
three events (holding a roof, upstream flow limitation, and crack-filling action) must be considered when assessing factors for progression. Upstream
flow limitation and crack-filling action are associated with zoned embankments, which are rare for levees. Therefore, they were omitted from the
factors provided below.

For holding a roof, two primary factors are the presence of continuous harder soil layers (e.g., hardpan or caliche) or embedded structures (e.g.,
pipes/culverts, pump stations, outlet structures, etc.) and the fines content being greater than or equal to 15% regardless of the plasticity of the
fines. Since most levees are homogenous earthfill embankments, the embankment can provide a roof to a developing pipe in the embankment because it is
typically constructed of impervious soils or semi-impervious soils with sufficient fines. <TableReference tableKey="table-10" /> provides general
guidance to assess the likelihood of a soil’s ability to hold a roof to a pipe as a function of soil classification, fines content, plasticity of
fines, and moisture condition.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Progression

1. Continuous harder soil layers (e.g., hardpan or caliche) form the roof of the pipe/crack.

1. Continuous embedded structures (e.g., pipes/culverts, pump stations, outlet structures, etc.) form the roof of the pipe/crack.

1. Roof or sidewalls of the pipe/crack will not collapse or swell closed. In general, if the fines content is greater than or equal to 15%, the soil
   will hold a roof, regardless of the plasticity of the fines. <TableReference tableKey="table-10" /> provides general guidance to assess the
   likelihood of a soil’s ability to hold a roof.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Progression

1. Roof or sidewalls of the pipe/crack will collapse. <TableReference tableKey="table-10" /> provides general guidance to assess the likelihood of a
   soil’s ability to hold a roof. Non-plastic silts, sands, and gravels will generally not hold a roof since the roof collapses upon saturation.
   Partially saturated and high fines content non-plastic soils may hold a roof near the phreatic surface, but the roof is sustained by pore pressure
   suction and may collapse upon saturation. Some secondary factors to consider are as follows: moist soils are more likely to collapse upon saturation
   than saturated soils; loose soils are less likely to hold a roof than dense soils; and cyclic reservoir levels are more likely to cause roof collapse
   than steady reservoir levels.

1. Sides of the pipe/crack will swell upon wetting, closing the pipe/crack, or reducing the opening and reducing hydraulic shear stresses on the
   surface of the pipe/crack in moderate-to-high plasticity embankment soils.

1. Hydraulic fracture is not sustained by hydraulic pressure to advance from waterside to landside if the flood duration is very short.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Progression

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for IE Embankment (CLE) to
progress as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically due to uncertainty with the embankment characterization.

### IE Embankment (CLE) - Unsuccessful Intervention

Unsuccessful intervention considers the likelihood that human efforts to detect and stop (or slow) the internal erosion process from breaching the
embankment fail to work. Both events must be considered when assessing factors for unsuccessful intervention.

Detection considers whether or when the developing failure mode would be observed and recognized as a problem. A concentrated leak must be observable
to be detectable, and vegetation or encroachments can obscure emergence of leakage containing eroded particles on the landside slope, around
pipes/culverts, or at the landside toe. Having adequate monitoring plans in the operation and maintenance manual is a key consideration for detection.

The ability to successfully intervene depends on whether mitigating efforts can be implemented in time to stop (or slow) the internal erosion process
to the point where breach does not occur. Given the leakage is observable and detectable, the likelihood of successful intervention depends on several
factors including the time available to intervene based on the rate of erosion (which is a function of embankment erodibility); the accessibility of
the project and the concentrated leak entrance or exit; and the availability of personnel, equipment, and materials. The size of the flood event is
also important. Large events can have regional impacts which can limit the availability of personnel since they may be spread out of several projects.
Having adequate flood-fighting protocols in the operation and maintenance manual is a key consideration for intervention and repair.

Historical performance data notes over 275 documented incidents of successful flood fights associated with IE embankment that prevented a potential
breach from occurring. Similar to other PFMs, most documented incidents of significant flood fighting are not explicit enough to determine at exactly
what point along the event tree path that actions were taken to prevent a breach. Assuming there is adequate time, experience, personnel and supplies,
there is a good chance that flood fight actions will be successful in prevent a breach in most cases.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Unsuccessful Intervention

A Likely rating for unsuccessful intervention is a <em>negative</em> rating, meaning the assessor does not think intervention will be successful.
Examples of when a Likely rating would be appropriate include:

1. Intervention has been attempted and failed in the past, and emergency preparedness (e.g., planning, necessary personnel and materials, etc.) has
   not improved.

1. The emergence of leakage is obscured by tailwater, marsh areas, dense vegetation, blankets, encroachments, etc. and/or the frequency of inspections
   is inadequate such that detection is unlikely. If the leakage cannot be detected, intervention cannot occur. <FigReference figKey="figure-82" /> is
   an example of vegetation and encroachments that would warrant a Likely rating for unsuccessful intervention.

1. The embankment materials are highly erodible (e.g., silts/sands, poorly compacted, etc.), and there may be insufficient time to successfully
   intervene once the impounded water level reaches the level of the crack, high-permeability zone, or level at which hydraulic fracture is induced.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Unsuccessful Intervention

An Unlikely rating for unsuccessful intervention is a <em>positive</em> rating that will significantly reduce the probability of breach, meaning the
assessor believes that intervention (i.e., flood fighting) will be successful.

1. Intervention has successfully prevented breach in the past for this performance mode, and emergency preparedness has not changed significantly
   since that experience (e.g., experienced owner/operator, personnel and materials are still available, etc.). [Note: If intervention was required for
   water levels less than full load, the potential for multiple locations requiring intervention under future loads should be considered and may still
   warrant a Likely or Neutral rating even if past intervention has been successful.]

1. Flood-fighting protocols are documented in the operation and maintenance manual. Emergence of leakage is not obscured by tailwater, marsh areas,
   dense vegetation, blankets, encroachments, etc. and the frequency of inspections is adequate such that detection is likely.

1. The embankment materials are erosion-resistant (e.g., stiff/dense, plastic materials), and erosion and enlargement of the leakage pathway is
   expected to occur slowly allowing extra time for detection and intervention. [Note: An Unlikely rating may still be appropriate in this situation if
   there are obstructions present on the landside slope that are not easily removed.]

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (CLE) Unsuccessful Intervention

A Neutral rating should be applied when the assessor is highly uncertain about the maintaining agency’s ability to identify issues during an event and
intervene prior to breach. Examples of when a Neutral rating is appropriate include:

1. The maintaining agency has not attempted intervention in the past, but they have plans and materials in place to attempt intervention. However, the
   embankment materials are highly erodible (e.g., silts/sands, poorly compacted, etc.), and there may be insufficient time to detect the leakage and
   successfully intervene.

1. Access to the landside slope where concentrated leaks are likely to occur is limited. <FigReference figKey="figure-83" /> is an example where
   several large, bulky items have been placed near the levee toe, preventing quick access during a high-water event for inspection and flood fighting.

### IE Embankment - Internal Migration (IM)

Internal migration is erosion of soil particles into open defects that initiates voids at the interface with the soil that expand (or stope) upward as
temporary roofs collapse. Soil particles migrate downward primarily due to gravity but will be aggravated by seepage or precipitation. For
pipes/culverts, the soil particles are carried by flow through the pipe. The process usually results in sinkhole formation as shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-100" /> for internal migration into a pipe/culvert.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-100"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure100.png"
  alt="Internal Migration into a Pipe/Culvert."
  caption="Internal Migration into a Pipe/Culvert."
/>

If the sinkhole is located on the waterside slope as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-101" />, full hydraulic head may be introduced to a more
landside location and trigger another failure mode (such as concentrated leak erosion or progressive slope instability). If the sinkhole is located on
a narrow crown, it could lower the crown below the impounded water level.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-101"

  alt="Sinkhole on Waterside Slope from Internal Migration (FEMA 2005a)."
  caption="Sinkhole on Waterside Slope from Internal Migration (FEMA 2005a)."
/>

<FigReference figKey="figure-102" /> shows the simplified event tree used in LST 2.0 for internal migration. Considerations when rating each node for
a fully loaded (100% of levee height) flood scenario are described in the following sections.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-102"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure102.png"
  alt="Simplified Event Tree for Internal Migration."
  caption="Simplified Event Tree for Internal Migration."
/>

### IE Embankment (IM) - Initiation

An open joint/defect must exist in an embedded culvert/pipe that allows the internal migration of the adjacent embankment material into the defect.
Soil particles migrate downward primarily due to gravity but will be aggravated by seepage or precipitation that provide a downward vertical gradient.
Both events must be considered when assessing factors for initiation. Eroded soil particles are carried by flow through the culvert/pipe.

The RMC Pipe Service Life Toolbox can be used to help assess the remaining service life of steel, aluminum, concrete, iron, plastic, and clay
culvert/pipe materials, especially for the invert, when the existing condition is unknown due to lack of recent detailed inspection (i.e., full
interior of pipe clearly visible for walk through or video camera inspection within 5 years of the evaluation). The toolbox assess the body of the
pipe only and does not account for connection flaws, joint separation due to settlement, etc.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Initiation

1. Open joints/defects or roots exist in the culvert/pipe based on a recent visual inspection as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-103" /> or from
   a video camera inspection as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-104" />.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-103"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure103.png"
  alt="Deterioration (Flaw) of Galvanized Corrugated Steel Pipe."
  caption="Deterioration (Flaw) of Galvanized Corrugated Steel Pipe."

  alt="Separated Joint (Flaw) of Reinforced Concrete Pipe."
  caption="Separated Joint (Flaw) of Reinforced Concrete Pipe."
/>

1. The interior condition of the culvert/pipe has not been recently verified using visual or video camera inspection methods, and the RMC Pipe Service
   Life Toolbox indicates the culvert/pipe is likely near the end of service life or has likely exceeded service life. Key factors from the toolbox
   evaluation should be described in the rationale. The toolbox does not account for connection flaws, joint separation due to settlement, etc.

1. Sinkholes or deformation exist on the crown or slopes overlying a culvert/pipe indicating internal migration is likely.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Initiation

1. The interior condition of the culvert/pipe has not been recently verified using visual or video camera inspection methods, but the RMC Pipe Service
   Life Toolbox indicates the culvert/pipe is not near the end of service life. Key factors from the toolbox evaluation should be described in the
   rationale. The toolbox does not account for connection flaws, joint separation due to settlement, etc.

#### Factors that support “Very Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Initiation

1. A recent visual or video camera inspection show there are no open joints/defects in the culvert/pipe which is in overall good condition.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Initiation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for IE Embankment (IM) to initiate
as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the condition of the culvert/pipe and remaining service life.

### IE Embankment (IM) - Continuation

For erosion to continue, the open joint/defect in the culvert/pipe needs to be sufficiently open to allow the surrounding soil particles to pass
through it as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-105" />. Effective opening size of open joints/defects are compared against the particle-size
diameter of the base material (adjacent embankment) corresponding to 95% passing on the cumulative particle-size distribution curve (D<sub>95</sub>B)
to assess whether internal migration will continue.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-105"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure105.png"
  alt="Internal Migration into an Open Crack/Joint in Culvert/Pipe (Fell et al. 2008)."
  caption="Internal Migration into an Open Crack/Joint in Culvert/Pipe (Fell et al. 2008)."
/>

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Continuation

1. Size of open joint/defect in culvert/pipe is greater than or equal to the coarsest D<sub>95</sub>B after regrading (i.e., likely sufficient for
   soil particle movement to occur).

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Continuation

1. Size of open joint/defect in culvert/pipe is less than the coarsest D<sub>95</sub>B after regrading (i.e., no likely sufficient for soil particle
   movement to occur.

1. Culvert or pipe has been slipped-lined.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Continuation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for IE Embankment (IM) to continue
as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the condition of the culvert/pipe and remaining service life.

### IE Embankment (IM) - Progression

During progression, the leakage fails to clog, and a stope develops. The common progression node of “holding a roof” applies to concentrated leak
erosion and is not evaluated for this internal erosion process.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Progression

1. Leakage pathway into culvert/pipe will not clog by larger particles in the embankment or accumulation of particles in the culvert/pipe that are not
   carried away by the flow gradient in the culvert/pipe.

1. The flood duration after sinkhole development is sufficient for the sinkhole to significantly enlarge and/or for retrogressive instability to lower
   the crown below the impounded water level.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Progression

1. Leakage pathway into culvert/pipe will clog by larger particles in the embankment or accumulation of particles in the culvert/pipe that are not
   carried away by the flow gradient in the culvert/pipe.

1. The flood duration after sinkhole development on the slope or crown is not sufficient for the sinkhole to significantly enlarge and/or for
   retrogressive instability to lower the crown below the impounded water level. <FigReference figKey="figure-106" /> is an example a sinkhole at the
   toe of a levee.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-106"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure106.png"
  alt="Sinkhole overlying a Collapsed Culvert at the Toe of a Levee."
  caption="Sinkhole overlying a Collapsed Culvert at the Toe of a Levee."
/>

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Progression

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for IE Embankment (IM) to progress
as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the condition of the culvert/pipe and remaining service life or the
characterization (i.e., particle-size distribution of the adjacent embankment materials).

### IE Embankment (IM) - Unsuccessful Intervention

Unsuccessful intervention considers the likelihood that human efforts to detect and stop (or slow) the internal erosion process from breaching the
embankment fail to work. Both events must be considered when assessing factors for unsuccessful intervention.

Detection considers whether or when the developing failure mode would be observed and recognized as a problem. A depression/sinkhole must be
observable to be detectable, and water, vegetation, or encroachments can obscure depressions/sinkholes on the embankment. Having adequate monitoring
plans in the operation and maintenance manual is a key consideration for detection.

The ability to successfully intervene depends on whether mitigating efforts can be implemented in time to stop (or slow) the internal erosion process
to the point where breach does not occur. Given the sinkhole is observable and detectable, the likelihood of successful intervention depends on
several factors including the time available to intervene based on the rate of sinkhole enlargement; duration of flood loading near the crown; the
accessibility of the project and the sinkhole location; and the availability of personnel, equipment, and materials. The size of the flood event is
also important. Large events can have regional impacts which can limit the availability of personnel since they may be spread out of several projects.
Having adequate flood-fighting protocols in the operation and maintenance manual is a key consideration for intervention and repair. Sinkholes often
appear on the receding limb of the flood hydrograph for the river, but these would likely be repaired before a subsequent flood.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Unsuccessful Intervention

A Likely rating for unsuccessful intervention is a <em>negative</em> rating, meaning the assessor does not think intervention will be successful.
Examples of when a Likely rating would be appropriate include:

1. Intervention has been attempted and failed in the past, and emergency preparedness (e.g., planning, necessary personnel and materials, etc.) has
   not improved.

1. The sinkhole is obscured by dense vegetation, encroachments, etc., and/or the frequency of inspections is inadequate such that detection is
   unlikely. If the sinkhole cannot be detected, intervention cannot occur. <FigReference figKey="figure-82" /> is an example of vegetation and
   encroachments that would warrant a Likely rating for unsuccessful intervention.

1. The sinkhole is located on the crown, and there may be insufficient time to successfully intervene.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Unsuccessful Intervention

An Unlikely rating for unsuccessful intervention is a <em>positive</em> rating that will significantly reduce the probability of breach, meaning the
assessor believes that intervention (i.e., flood fighting) will be successful.

1. Intervention has successfully prevented breach in the past for this performance mode, and emergency preparedness has not changed significantly
   since that experience (e.g., experienced owner/operator, personnel and materials are still available, etc.). [Note: If intervention was required for
   water levels less than full load, the potential for multiple locations requiring intervention under future loads should be considered and may still
   warrant a Likely or Neutral rating even if past intervention has been successful.]

1. Flood-fighting protocols are documented in the operation and maintenance manual. The sinkhole is not obscured by dense vegetation, encroachments,
   etc., and the frequency of inspections is adequate such that detection is likely.

1. The sinkhole is located on the landside slope allowing extra time for detection and intervention. [Note: An Unlikely rating may still be
   appropriate in this situation if there are obstructions present on the landside slope that are not easily removed.]

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on IE Embankment (IM) Unsuccessful Intervention

A Neutral rating should be applied when the assessor is highly uncertain about the maintaining agency’s ability to identify issues during an event and
intervene prior to breach. Examples of when a Neutral rating is appropriate include:

1. The maintaining agency has not attempted intervention in the past, but they have plans and materials in place to attempt intervention. However, the
   sinkhole is located on a narrow crown, and there may be insufficient time to detect the leakage and successfully intervene.

1. Access to the sinkhole location is limited. For example, large, bulky items may prevent quick access during a high-water event for inspection and
   flood fighting. <FigReference figKey="figure-83" /> is an example where several large, bulky items have been placed near the levee toe, preventing
   quick access during a high-water event for inspection and flood fighting.

## Embankment Slope Instability

Slope instability occurs when the levee embankment and/or foundation soils (or natural slopes on the abutment) undergo movement when the shear
strength of the soil is less than the shear stress required for equilibrium. To exceed this equilibrium condition, either the shear strength of the
soils must be reduced or the loading changes to increase the shear stresses within the soil, or a combination of both.

Slip or failure surfaces are the surfaces along which the soil movement occurs. They can occur on the waterside or landside slopes (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-107" />), throughout the life of a project, and triggered by short-term or long-term loading conditions, as
summarized in <FigReference figKey="figure-108" />. However, the primary focus of LST 2.0 is instability of landside slopes during a flood loading,
not seismic or rapid drawdown instability of waterside slopes since that is unlikely to lead to breach because damaged areas will be known and can be
repaired before a subsequent flood event. Even with breach for those loading scenarios, life loss is less likely to occur given awareness of the
damaged condition.

The slip surfaces can be global (deep-seated) or local (shallow). Deep-seated slides can directly lower the crown below the impounded water level
(i.e., a levee breach). <FigReference figKey="figure-107" /> is an example of a deep-seated slides on both the waterside and landside slopes. Shallow
slides (or maintenance slides) are generally not significant enough to cause a levee breach but could weaken the levee. Long-term creep or
retrogressive instability of the remnant embankment may eventually lead to overtopping erosion and breach, or the remnant embankment may be more
susceptible to internal erosion potential failure modes (such as concentrated leak erosion through transverse cracks). In many cases, intervention for
shallow slides is likely to occur before breach of the remnant embankment during a subsequent flood.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-107"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure107.png"
  alt="Example of Deep-Seated Slides."
  caption="Example of Deep-Seated Slides."
/>

<Figure
  figKey="figure-108"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure108.png"
  alt="Example Slope Loading Conditions and Typical Associated Design Factors of Safety for Levee Evaluations."
  caption="Example Slope Loading Conditions and Typical Associated Design Factors of Safety for Levee Evaluations."
/>

The slip surface can be circular or noncircular (such as wedge-shaped). The stratigraphy often governs where the critical slip surface will be
located. If a relatively weak zone exists, the critical slip surface will likely pass through it. Similarly, if the weak zone is relatively thin and
linear, the slip surface may follow the weak layer and is more likely to be noncircular than circular.

Slope instability can also adversely impact critical internal seepage control features (such as filters, toe drains, relief wells, and seepage barrier
walls) and adjacent appurtenant structures (such as pump stations and outlet structures). These often do not result in immediate breach, but if the
remnant embankment and damaged features and appurtenant structures are not repaired before a subsequent flood, the levee may be vulnerable to breach
at a lower impounded water level during the subsequent flood. Since the primary focus of LST 2.0 is performance during a flood loading for existing
conditions, those impacts should be discussed in the major findings and understandings section.

<FigReference figKey="figure-109" /> shows the simplified event tree used in LST 2.0 for slope instability. Considerations when rating each node for a
fully loaded (100% of levee height) flood scenario are described in the following sections.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-109"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure109.png"
  alt="Simplified Event Tree for Embankment Slope Instability."
  caption="Simplified Event Tree for Embankment Slope Instability."
/>

While there are many documented incidents of embankment slope instability distress, this PFM has the lowest failure rate of all PFMs including those
associated with floodwalls. Most documented slope instability incidents tend to be associated with relatively shallow slip surfaces at areas where
there was an existing longitudinal crack that had formed. This is typically due to the use of expansive clays when the levee embankment was constructed.
There have been a few documented failures associated with embankment slope instability but even these had extenuating circumstances such as a large
tree root ball pulled out of the levee slope. From an actual failure standpoint, this PFM is much less concerning compared to other embankment-related
PFMs.

### Embankment Slope Instability - Initiation

For slope instability to occur, a flaw must exist that causes either a decrease in shear strength or an increase in shear stress, or a combination of
both. Given a flaw exists, slope movement must be triggered by the flood loading. Both events must be considered when assessing factors for
initiation.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Instability Initiation

<TableReference tableKey="table-11" /> provides typical processes and mechanisms that can initiate slope instability leading to overtopping erosion
and breach. Some of these are illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-110" />. Although the figure is for dams, the same conditions apply to
levees, except for “small freeboard compared to levee height” because ratings are for a fully loaded (100% of levee height) flood scenario.

1. Instrumentation and monitoring provide evidence of deep-seated slides and lateral spreading. Absent instrumentation data, the primary visual
   indicators of instability include, but are not limited to, slides, bulges, seepage, and cracks as described below. Performance history is based on
   inspection with water near the top of the levee (>75% of levee height) and relatively recent such that the potential adverse factors supporting a
   “Likely” rating below are likely unchanged since the last significant high-water event.

1. Inclinometer readings indicate deep-seated subsurface movement.

1. A well-defined scarp exists on or near the embankment crown, or a toe bulge exists at the landside toe as shown in
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-111" />. A scarp is a relatively flat area with a steep back slope, and a toe bulge is the lower portion of a slide
   and evidence of rotational or horizontal movement of embankment material. Both can be associated with deep-seated slides.

  caption="Deep-Seated Slide (FEMA 2007)."
/>

1. Longitudinal or tension cracks exist on the crown, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-112" />, can fill with water, increasing the driving
   load that increases shear stresses in the soil within the slope. Rainfall can also infiltrate the crown due to rutting and poor drainage. If cracks
   remain filled with water long enough for seepage towards the landside slope face to develop, pore pressures may increase decreasing the soil’s shear
   strength. Desiccation cracking of fat clays can lead to more rapid saturation of an embankment or slope than non-desiccated conditions and further
   contribute to deep-seated slides following extended dry periods followed by significant rainfall.

1. Excessive settlement of the crown, longitudinal cracks on the slope, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-113" />, and bulges at the toe of
   the slope exist as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-114" />. These can be associated with lateral spreading.

  alt="Lateral Spreading (FEMA 2007)."
  caption="Lateral Spreading (FEMA 2007)."
/>

1. Arc-shaped cracks in the slope exist. Such cracks are evidence that a slide is beginning, and this type of crack may develop into a large scarp
   in the slope at the top of the slide.

1. Cracking and misalignment of guardrails, pavement stripes, utility poles, appurtenant structures, etc. exist. Both can be associated with
   deep-seated slides.

1. A slope stability analysis using appropriate geometry, embankment zoning, foundation stratigraphy, shear strength parameters, and phreatic
   conditions indicates marginal stability. [Note: Design factors of safety are shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-108" />.]

1. The embankment and/or foundation materials are susceptible to shear strength reduction, typically associated with excess pore pressures generated
   during flood loading. The first column in <TableReference tableKey="table-11" /> provides other factors that can cause a decrease in shear strength.

1. The embankment is vulnerable to reduction in shear strength related to dilation (fully softened or critical state conditions) or saturation.

1. A weaker zone in embankment exists due to culvert/pipe penetrations, roots, or poor backfill adjacent to embedded structures.
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-115" /> is an example of localized instability adjacent to the culvert outlet structure on the waterside slope.

<Figure

  caption="Example of Slope Instability near Culvert Outlet Structure"
/>

1. The levee embankment is cohesionless, pervious, and vulnerable to through-seepage instability or sloughing of the landside slope.

1. The embankment is poorly compacted and saturated making it vulnerable to flow slides.

1. The embankment slope is overly steep (i.e., 2H1:1V or steeper for lean clays and 4H:1V or steeper for sand levees, pervious hydraulic fill, and fat
   clays). The slope is over-steepened by movement or overturning of large diameter trees which can also loosen a zone of embankment material as shown
   in <FigReference figKey="figure-116" />.

1. Stockpiled material, levee embankment raises, building construction, or other conditions surcharge the crown, imparting additional driving load
   that increases the shear stress required for equilibrium of the slope.

1. A ditch or other excavation at the toe makes the landside slope steeper or taller, removing toe resistance to instability that increases shear
   stresses in the soil within the slope. [Note: Scour erosion of the waterside toe is a separate performance mode.]

1. Changes in seepage or groundwater conditions have occurred (e.g., drawdown due to irrigation). [Note: Rapid drawdown instability of waterside
   slopes due to sudden changes in the waterside water levels are not evaluated under this performance mode.]

1. Other conditions exist that change vertical or horizontal stresses (e.g., water line).

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Initiation

<FigReference figKey="figure-117" /> shows conditions where breach by slope instability, leading to overtopping erosion and breach, are more likely to
occur. Although the figure is for dams, the same conditions apply to levees, except for “large freeboard compared to levee height” because ratings
are for a fully loaded (100% of levee height) flood scenario.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-117"

  alt="Conditions where Breach by Slope Instability is Less Likely (Fell et al. 2008)."
  caption="Conditions where Breach by Slope Instability is Less Likely (Fell et al. 2008)."
/>

1. Instrumentation and monitoring provide no evidence of deep-seated slides and lateral spreading. Absent instrumentation data, the primary visual
   indicators of instability include, but are not limited to, slides, bulges, seepage, and cracks as described below. Performance history is based on
   inspection with water near the top of the levee (>75% of levee height) and relatively recent such that the potential favorable factors supporting an
   “Unlikely” rating below are likely unchanged since the last significant high-water event.

1. Inclinometer readings provide no evidence of deep-seated subsurface movement.

1. No deep-seated slides, sloughs, longitudinal/tension cracks, scarps, bulges, or excessive settlement exist on the embankment.

1. Minor slope stability indicators exist that do not pose an immediate threat to the levee embankment. For example, shallow slides may occur after
   heavy rainfall. These slides are often called “slough slides” or “maintenance slides.” Shallow slides do not threaten the stability of the crown as
   shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-118" />. Long-term creep or retrogressive instability of the remnant embankment is needed to lower the crown
   below the impounded water level given the flood hydrograph of the river.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-118"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure118.png"
  alt="Shallow Slide (FEMA 2007)."
  caption="Shallow Slide (FEMA 2007)."
/>

1. Guardrails, pavement stripes, utility poles, appurtenant structures, etc. are not misaligned.

1. A slope stability analysis using appropriate geometry, embankment zoning, foundation stratigraphy, shear strength parameters, and phreatic
   conditions indicates significant margin of safety against instability (i.e., factors of safety around unity).

1. The embankment and/or foundation materials are not susceptible to shear strength reduction, typically associated with excess pore pressures
   generated during flood loading. The first column in <TableReference tableKey="table-11" /> provides other factors that can cause a decrease in shear
   strength.

1. No embedded pipes/culverts traverse the embankment.

1. The embankment contains a drainage zone with adequate capacity that will prevent buildup of pore pressures in landside zones. Zoned embankments are
   rare for levees.

1. The embankment slope is relatively flat (i.e., 3H1:1V or flatter for lean clays and 5H:1V or steeper for sand levees, pervious hydraulic fill, and
   fat clays.

1. The crown does not contain stockpiled material, embankment raises, building construction, or other conditions that surcharge the crown.

1. A stability berm exists at the landside toe that imparts addition resistance to sliding. [Note: Depending on their design, seepage berms can also
   function as stability berms.]

1. Changes in seepage or groundwater conditions have not occurred (e.g., drawdown due to irrigation).

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Initiation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for Embankment Slope Instability
to initiate as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically due to uncertainty with the characterization of the embankment and/or foundation, limited
performance or loading history, or the influence of contributing factors. Although hummocky and irregular slope surfaces are evidence of movement of
embankment material, it may not be clear whether the movement is associated with deep-seated or shallow slides. Another source of uncertainty is flood
duration for retrogressive instability of shallow slides to lead to breach.

### Embankment Slope Instability - Continuation

Once embankment slope instability is initiated, movement will continue unless there is higher shear strength zone exists in the embankment or
foundation to arrest retrogressive instability.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Continuation

1. No higher shear strength zone exists in the embankment or foundation to arrest retrogressive instability.

1. No slope reinforcing elements (e.g., soldier piles, drilled shafts, or seepage barrier walls) exist in the embankment.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Continuation

1. A higher shear strength zone exists in the embankment or foundation to arrest retrogressive instability.

1. Slope reinforcing elements (e.g., soldier piles, drilled shafts, or seepage barrier walls) exist in the embankment.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Continuation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for Embankment Slope Instability
to continue as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically due to uncertainty with the characterization of the embankment and/or foundation.

### Embankment Slope Instability - Progression

Progression is the process of retrogressive slope instability advancing through the crown or lowering the crown below the impounded water level. It
considers flood duration, embankment geometry, and characteristics of the slip surface.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Progression

1. Global or deep-seated instability includes all or most of the crown.

1. The crown is relatively narrow. Crown widths narrower than 10 or 12 feet can cause sloughing at edge of the crown during maintenance and
   flood-fighting operations. Retrogressive instability of the remnant embankment following a deep-seated slide is more likely to advance through the
   crown during the same flood event.

1. Flood duration is sufficient for retrogressive instability of shallow slides to advance through the crown.

1. Slope instability adversely impacts critical seepage control features (such as filters, toe drains, relief wells or seepage barrier walls) and
   adjacent appurtenant structures (such as pump stations and outlet structures), and the flood duration is sufficient to initiate and progress another
   failure mode.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Progression

1. Global or deep-seated instability does not lower the crown elevation below the impounded water level.

1. The crown is relatively wide. Minimum crown widths of 10 to 12 feet are commonly used maintenance and flood-fighting operations. Retrogressive
   instability of the remnant embankment following a deep-seated slide is less likely to advance through the crown during the same flood event. For tall
   levees, crown widths greater than about 20 or 30 feet may be more appropriate.

1. Flood duration is not sufficient for retrogressive instability of shallow slides to advance through the crown.

1. Slope instability adversely impacts critical seepage control features (such as filters, toe drains, relief wells, or seepage barrier walls) and
   adjacent appurtenant structures (such as pump stations and outlet structures), and the flood duration is not sufficient to initiate and progress
   another failure mode.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Progression

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for Embankment Slope Instability
to progress as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically due to uncertainty with the magnitude of expected movements or flood duration for retrogressive
instability to advance through the crown.

### Embankment Slope Instability - Unsuccessful Intervention

Unsuccessful intervention considers the likelihood that human efforts to detect and stop (or slow) the slope instability from breaching the embankment
fail to work. Both events must be considered when assessing factors for unsuccessful intervention.

Detection considers whether or when the developing failure mode would be observed and recognized as a problem. The slide must be observable to be
detectable, and vegetation or encroachments can obscure slope movements. Having adequate monitoring plans in the operation and maintenance manual is a
key consideration for detection.

The ability to successfully intervene depends on whether mitigating efforts can be implemented in time to stop (or slow) the slope instability to the
point where breach does not occur. Given the slide is observable and detectable, the likelihood of successful intervention depends on several factors
including the time available to intervene based on the rate of retrogressive instability; the accessibility of the project and the slide location; and
the availability of personnel, equipment, and materials. The size of the flood event is also important. Large events can have regional impacts which
can limit the availability of personnel since they may be spread out of several projects. Having adequate flood-fighting protocols in the operation
and maintenance manual is a key consideration for intervention and repair.

There have been 35 documented incidents where flood fighting was assessed to have prevented a potential levee breach from occurring at a location
where excessive slope instability was occurring. This is much less than when compared to other embankment related PFMs in terms of documented
incidents. The flood fight measures themselves were successful in significantly reducing the likelihood of failure, but there are many less documented
incidents overall associated with this PFM. In most of these cases, a slip surface formed during the flooding event and action was taken to stabilize
the slope after the initial instability occurred.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Unsuccessful Intervention

A likely rating on unsuccessful intervention is a negative rating, meaning the assessor does not think intervention will be successful. Examples of
when a Likely rating would be appropriate include:

1. Intervention has been attempted and failed in the past, and conditions (e.g., planning, access to necessary materials, etc.) have not changed.

1. The slide is obscured by dense vegetation, encroachments, etc. and/or the frequency of inspections is inadequate such that detection is unlikely.
   If the slide cannot be detected, intervention cannot occur. <FigReference figKey="figure-82" /> is an example of vegetation and encroachments that
   would warrant a Likely rating for unsuccessful intervention.

1. The slide is located on or near the crown, and there may be insufficient time to successfully intervene.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Unsuccessful Intervention

An unlikely rating on unsuccessful intervention is a positive rating that will significantly reduce the probability of breach, meaning the assessor
believes that intervention (i.e., flood fighting) will be successful.

1. Intervention has successfully prevented breach in the past for this performance mode, and emergency preparedness has not changed significantly
   since that experience (e.g., experienced owner/operator, personnel and materials are still available, etc.). [Note: If intervention was required for
   water levels less than full load, the potential for multiple locations requiring intervention under future loads should be considered and may still
   warrant a Likely or Neutral rating even if past intervention has been successful.]

1. Flood-fighting protocols are documented in the operation and maintenance manual. The slide is not obscured by dense vegetation, encroachments,
   etc., and the frequency of inspections is adequate such that detection is likely.

1. The slide is shallow, or the scarp is located away from the crown allowing extra time for detection and intervention. [Note: An Unlikely rating may
   still be appropriate in this situation if there are obstructions present on the landside slope that are not easily removed.]

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Slope Instability Unsuccessful Intervention

1. The maintaining agency has not attempted intervention in the past, but they have plans and materials in place to attempt intervention. However, the
   scarp of the slide is located near a narrow crown, and there may be insufficient time to detect the leakage and successfully intervene.

1. Access to the slide location is limited. For example, large, bulky items may prevent quick access during a high-water event for inspection and
   flood fighting. <FigReference figKey="figure-83" /> is an example where several large, bulky items have been placed near the levee toe, preventing
   quick access during a high-water event for inspection and flood fighting.

## Embankment Riverine Erosion

High velocity flows along levee embankments can remove existing revetments and begin eroding the levee embankment. If the duration of those flows is
long enough, and no erosion resistant materials are embedded in the levee, erosion can continue and lead to a breach of the levee unless intervention
is successful.

The leading cause of levee failures across the entire loading range (toe to crest) is embankment riverine erosion. There have more documented failures
due to this PFM than all others (when considering internal erosion in the foundation and embankment as separate PFMs). Internal erosion related PFMs
have a higher failure rate at the highest loading range (above 90% loading height), but embankment riverine erosion has much higher failure rates at
lower loading ranges. Part of this is due to the fact that riverine erosion can rapidly fail an embankment when the river velocity is high and loading
is flashy. Also, much of the initial damage may go unnoticed because it is occurring under water and is not clearly visible. Levee embankment
distress due to riverine erosion is common in many levees in the western United States. There is little opportunity to intervene in these situations
where an erodible embankment is subjected to high velocity flow and isn’t adequately designed/constructed to prevent erosion damage from occurring.

The event tree for embankment riverine erosion is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-119" />. Information from the Levee Loading and Incident
Database shows that riverine erosion leading to breach mostly likely occurs:

- At previous damage areas,

- Where existing bank protection is inadequate,

- Where there is a design or construction deficiency, or

- At bridge crossings or where debris has stacked up and caused turbulent flow near the levee embankment.

Rating the nodes for the embankment riverine erosion event tree requires judgement, based on weighing several factors, such as levee embankment
material, relative compaction level, quality of the grass cover, presence of adverse vegetation, encroachments, culverts/discharge pipes and
revetments (riprap and non-riprap).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-119"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure119.png"
  alt="Riverine Embankment Erosion Event Tree"
  caption="Riverine Embankment Erosion Event Tree"
/>

As with the other performance modes, past performance is often the best indicator of future erosion potential. For example, past reports of scour and
erosion repairs can be indicative of potential future problems. When looking at reports, consider whether past erosion problems were due to conditions
unique to a specific site or whether similar conditions at other locations might lead to similar problems.

The extent of past repairs is important to consider. Try to determine if the past repairs were extensive enough to prevent future erosion for the
entire levee segment or just at the location(s) of previous poor performance.

The context of past performance is also important to consider. If loading has not been near the top of the levee, only limited performance information
can be inferred for top-of-levee loading.

### Soil erodibility and stream velocity as an erosion indicator

The erodibility of the soil plays a key role in the likelihood of a levee breaching during a flood event. On many occasions, erosion-resistant levees constructed
of well-compacted clays with good grass cover have survived long-duration floods up to the top and including extensive overtopping without major
damage. On the other hand, there have been many cases in which levees have breached or been significantly damaged at loads considerably lower than the
top of the levee, particularly when levees were not compacted well and/or erodible soils were used to construct the levee or are present in the levee
foundation and exposed to erosive currents or waves.

Embankment erosion is ultimately a function of flow velocity and erodibility of the soil; there have been many detailed studies to establish formal
relationships between these two factors. However, the level of detail required to analyze the risks associated with embankment erosion along an entire
length of levee is beyond the scope of the LST evaluation. Instead, simplified general relationships relating flow velocity and erodibility can help
you assess qualitatively levee embankment and foundation erosion susceptibility.

One of the most important soil parameters in erosion studies is the threshold of erosion. Below this threshold, erosion does not occur. In terms of
shear stress, the threshold is the critical shear stress versus critical velocity. Five broad categories of erosion resistance relative to their ASTM
classification have been developed based upon laboratory studies. For simplicity, the calculated critical shear stress and erodibility coefficient
values from laboratory tests have been omitted; however, the broad categories can be used by the assessment team to determine an appropriate rating
for erosion. The erosion-resistance categories (Hanson and Simon 2001) are as follows:

- Very resistant: boulders and cobbles.

- Resistant: gravel (GP-GW)

- Moderately resistant: clay (CL, CH, SC, and GC)

- Erodible: sand (SP, SM, and mixtures thereof)

- Very erodible: silt (ML)

<Citation citationKey="Briaud2008" /> proposed categories of soil erodibility presented in terms of flow velocity and added Unified Soil
Classification Symbols for those categories in <Citation citationKey="Briaud2019" />, as depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-120" />. It is important
to note that using the water velocity to evaluate erosion is less representative and leads to more uncertainty than using a calculated shear stress.
Nevertheless, this velocity chart is presented because it is easier to assess erosion potential qualitatively by comparing the characteristics of the
levee and/or its foundation to the flow velocity. This can help guide the assessor when the levee materials are known and the approximate flow
velocity is known. Velocities at critical locations such as river bends or breaks in levee alignment will be more critical and should be considered
when evaluating this performance mode.

Using <FigReference figKey="figure-120" />, most levee materials will fall into Class I-III unless they are armored. Levees that are armored on the
waterside with riprap for their entire height would fall under Class III-VI unless the revetment is in poor condition and considered ineffective. The
other aspect of the chart that is helpful is the consideration of compaction of the soils. Soils that are well compacted will erode more slowly than
those that are loosely compacted. Rolled impervious earthfill levees are usually well compacted and will usually be erosion-resistant, especially if
well-covered with an erosion resistant grass. In general, it is safe to assume that non-federally constructed levees are not well compacted as they
were constructed with limited resources, design, and oversight unless evidence to the contrary is available.

Well-compacted levees have a specified borrow material water content range, loose lift thickness of 6 to 9 inches, compaction by sheepsfoot or
rubber-tired rollers, number of passes to attain a given percent compaction or standard maximum density, and minimum required density.

Semi-compacted levees have a lift thickness of 1 to 2 feet, and are compacted by the movement of hauling and spreading equipment or sheepsfoot or
rubber-tired roller compaction equipment.

Uncompacted levees are constructed by fill cast or dumping in place thick layers of borrow materials with little or no spreading or compaction.
Hydraulic fill by dredge, often from channel excavations, is a common source for uncompacted levees. Hydraulic fills are known to be highly
susceptible to erosion upon overtopping (Independent Levee Investigation Team 2006).

According to <FigReference figKey="figure-120" />, an uncompacted levee constructed of fine sand or non-plastic silt would be the most erodible,
whereas a well-compacted levee constructed of intact/jointed rock would be the least erodible (the latter situation would never occur for a levee,
however). Both the material and level of compaction used to construct the levee should be considered when providing ratings for initiation,
continuation, and progressing nodes.

  caption="Proposed erosion categories for soils and rocks based on velocity (Briaud et al. 2019)"
/>

### Levee/foundation geometry and alignment as an erosion indicator

When considering the geometry of the levee/foundation for assessing the potential for embankment riverine erosion, use these guidelines:

- In general, steeper slopes on the waterside will be less stable and more susceptible to erosion damage then gentler slopes.

- Ideally, a slope of 2.5H:1V or flatter is desired for levee construction.

Most federally constructed levees will meet this requirement, but there may be some cases where steeper slopes are used. Many non-federally constructed
levees will have slopes that are steeper. Also, wider crowns provide additional resistance to breaching by erosion than those with narrower crowns
since they provide more material that must be eroded before the levee is breached. The bottom line is that wider, flatter levees are more resistant to
erosion breaching than narrower, steeper levees with all other factors being equal.

Alignment of the levee relative to the stream also plays a key role with respect to embankment erosion. River bend locations and breaks in levee
alignment are notorious for being locations of turbulent velocities well exceeding those associated with the typical, straight line stream flow.
Levees adjacent to sharp river bends are likely to suffer erosion/scour damage unless those areas are well protected with revetments.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-121" /> shows a stream bank adjacent to a levee that has been partially protected by riprap revetment, but where
adjacent stream bank sections are nearly vertical due to erosion. While the amount of erosion shown in this photo may not currently threaten the
integrity of the levee, there are many situations where the levee forms the stream bank and is likely to be damaged by the velocities in the river
bend location. Since the LST evaluation uses a “weakest link” approach, the screening team should determine if any of these known erosion locations
are likely to cause a significant performance issue for river velocities associated with top of levee loading. This is especially important for levees
whose waterside slopes are not protected against erosion around river bend locations.

In addition, if a levee is exposed to an adjacent, long-fetch body of water, it may be subject to wind-wave erosion. Generally, wave attack directly
at the levee is more severe than waves arriving at an angle. Various equations to estimate wave height based on storm intensity and duration are
available and can be compared to expected erosion rates based on sod/armor cover and levee and foundation soil types, but in general past performance
is the strongest indicator of expected future performance.

  alt="Stream bank erosion at a sharp bend in the river"
  caption="Stream bank erosion at a sharp bend in the river"
/>

### Event duration as an erosion indicator

Longer duration events are more damaging than shorter duration events for all performance modes, and embankment erosion is no exception. This is
particularly true when wind and waves play a significant role in the loading against the levee. Long duration events, such as riverine floods lasting
longer than a week, are much more likely to cause erosion damage than shorter duration events. The same is true for wind-driven events causing surge
and waves.

### Embankment Riverine Erosion - Initiation

The first node in the embankment riverine erosion failure mode is initiation, which assesses the likelihood that flow in the river during an event
with water near the top of the levee will be sufficient to remove any vegetation (or other resilient features) that may exist and start eroding the
levee embankment soil. Factors to consider are water velocity, slope protection, embankment material and compaction, duration of flood event, and
irregularities such as large trees or gravity outlets that could cause localized turbulence.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Initiation

1. The levee has experienced riverine erosion during historic events, regardless of whether it ultimately breached, and nothing has changed that would
   prevent erosion during future events. If historic damage has been repaired and slope protection added, the screening team should use judgement as to
   whether similar issues are likely to occur at other areas of the levee segment during higher flows that do not have slope protection.

1. The riverside embankment lacks consistent vegetal cover or other slope protection, consists of erosive or semi-erosive material, and velocities are
   expected to be high enough to initiate erosion (refer to <FigReference figKey="figure-120" /> for guidance on relationship between velocity and
   material type).

1. Sharp bends in the river or large fetches exist without erosion protection, where lower velocity flows or wind/wave action could initiate erosion.

1. Vegetation or structures (e.g., bridge piers) in floodway constrict and concentrate flow, increasing flow velocity adjacent to embankment.

1. Vegetation (including root balls, foliage, and trunks from overturned trees), conduits, pipes, culverts, or other structures protrude into the flow
   (without proper erosion control), leading to turbulence that could cause erosion of the embankment as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-124" />.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-124"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure124.png"
  alt="Evidence for a Likely rating for Initiation of Riverine Embankment Erosion: Erosion/scour damage is evident at a gravity outlet through the base of the levee. The tree may also be contributing to erosion damage causing localized eddies."
  caption="Evidence for a Likely rating for Initiation of Riverine Embankment Erosion: Erosion/scour damage is evident at a gravity outlet through the base of the levee. The tree may also be contributing to erosion damage causing localized eddies."
/>

1. Large diameter trees exist on riverside slope that could overturn during large storm events due to saturation of embankment and high winds or due
   to high flow and velocities within river. Root ball from these trees create large pits that would be prime location for erosion to initiate.

1. Studies exist that suggest existing bank protection is inadequate to protect the entire embankment during large flow events.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Initiation

1. The levee has experience high flow events (> 75% levee height) without erosion induced damage to the riverside slope. Nothing significant has
   changed to the levee embankment slope protection that would make initiation of erosion more likely.

1. The levee has a well-maintained, consistent slope protection as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-125" />, and the combined duration and flow
   velocity are not expected to initiate erosion.

1. The levee is constructed out of erosion resistant soils that are not likely to erode given the flow velocities that are expected during high water
   events.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-125"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure125.png"
  alt="Evidence for an Unlikely Rating for Initiation of Embankment Riverine Erosion: This levee has excellent grass cover over its entire length."
  caption="Evidence for an Unlikely Rating for Initiation of Embankment Riverine Erosion: This levee has excellent grass cover over its entire length."
/>

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Initiation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for Embankment Riverine Erosion to
initiate as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the engineering characteristics of the embankment, flow
characteristics (e.g. velocity and duration) for large events, construction methods, limited load history, or the influence of contributing factors.

### Embankment Riverine Erosion – Continuation

Once initiated, erosion will continue unless the eroding forces are reduced or a zone of erosion resistant material is encountered. The only reason to
rate the continuation node for Embankment Riverine Erosion something other than Likely would be if there is an embedded non-erodible feature in the
levee (e.g. a cutoff wall or sheet pile wall) or the core of the levee is constructed of non-erodible material.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Continuation

The continuation node should be rated Likely unless one of the items listed under Unlikely or Neutral exist.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Continuation

A non-erodible feature exists within the levee, such as a cutoff wall or sheet pile wall that would prevent the erosion and related sloughing process from
breaching the levee crest. An example of this is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-126" /> where a steel sheet pile has been embedded in the
embankment to cut-off seepage, but could also act to prevent riverside erosion from cutting far enough into the levee to reach the crest. A cutoff
wall on the landside of the levee crest will not prevent continuation as the crest would be breached prior to erosion reaching the cutoff wall.
Embedment depth and overall stability of the wall should be considered to determine if potential scour and undermining of the cutoff wall would cause
it to fail during the erosion process.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Continuation

As with the other performance modes, a Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the
potential for Embankment Riverine Erosion to continue as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the engineering
characteristics of the embankment. In this case it would be reserved for situations where a non-erodible feature is embedded in the levee embankment
but the screening team does not have enough information to be reasonably confident that it would prevent erosion from continuing.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-126"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure126.png"
  alt="Steel sheet pile embedded in embankment"
  caption="Steel sheet pile embedded in embankment"
/>

### Embankment Riverine Erosion - Progression

The progression node for overtopping erosion considers whether overtopping flows will last long enough for the erosion or erosion and headcutting
process to breach the levee crest. The screening team must weigh the duration of the flood event against the physical dimensions and embankment
material of the levee at the incipient overtopping location to rate the progression node.

Narrow, highly erodible embankments subject to long duration flood events would warrant a “Likely” rating while wide embankments made up of erosion
resistant materials subjected to short duration events would warrant an “Unlikely” rating.

### Embankment Riverine Erosion – Unsuccessful Intervention

The unsuccessful intervention node considers the likelihood that human efforts to detect and stop (or slow) the riverine erosion process from
breaching the levee embankment fail to work. This node evaluates the potential that two activities will occur: 1) detection (i.e., whether, or when,
the developing failure mechanism would be observed and recognized as a problem); and 2) the ability to successfully intervene (i.e., can mitigating
efforts be implemented in time to stop or slow the failure process to the point where breach does not occur?).

The ability to detect and intervene before a potential riverine erosion concern becomes a breach is very challenging, primarily because evidence of
erosion would likely be obscured by higher water levels on the water side of the levee. Realistically, it would often be easier to detect occurrence
of riverine erosion if it occurred during lower water levels, as the erosion would be observable above the water line before it impacted the crest of
the levee.

As with the other failure modes, the levee embankment material will impact the ability to detect and intervene as highly erodible materials will allow
for less time to identify issues and mobilize the necessary people and equipment to allow for a successful intervention.

Finally, the signs of erosion must still be observed for intervention to be successful. Therefore, existence of a monitoring plan during high water
events should be considered when rating this node.

There have been over 180 documented incidents where flood fighting measures are believed to have prevented a levee embankment from breaching due to
riverine erosion; thus, successful intervention is possible if there is ample time to place the necessary materials (typically stone and/or a
combination of plastic sheeting/sandbags) to prevent the breach from occurring. This will be dependent on local conditions (water source, embankment
material, location, availability of personnel/materials, etc.). Some of the documented flood fight incidents include placement of these materials at
locations along the levee embankment that were already eroded from previous flood events but had not yet been repaired. Thus, not all of them are
considered ‘heroic’ flood fighting actions, but still likely prevented a breach from occurring even though the material was placed prior to the flood
arriving at the damage site. Overall, the likelihood of successful flood fighting for this PFM is considerably less than that associated with internal
erosion (embankment or foundation) due to a variety of factors and this should be considered when evaluating this node of the event tree.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Unsuccessful Intervention

A Likely rating on unsuccessful intervention is a negative rating, meaning the assessor does not think intervention will be successful. Generally, a
rating of Likely should be used unless strong justification exists as to how detection will occur and intervention will be successful.

The embankment materials are highly erodible (e.g., silts/sands, poorly compacted, etc.) and unprotected, and there may be insufficient time to
successfully intervene.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Unsuccessful Intervention

An unlikely rating on unsuccessful intervention is a positive rating that will significantly reduce the probability of breach, meaning the assessor
believes that intervention (i.e. flood fighting) will be successful.

Generally, a rating other than Likely for this node will require strong justification as to both ability to observe erosion and method for
intervening. Examples include:

1. Intervention has successfully prevented breach in the past <em>for this failure mode</em> and conditions have not changed significantly since that
   experience (e.g. experienced owner/operator, necessary materials are still available, etc). Importantly, if intervention was required under water
   levels less than full load, the potential for multiple locations requiring intervention under future loads should be considered and may still warrant
   a Likely or Neutral rating even if past intervention has been successful.

1. Monitoring plans and flood fighting protocols for this failure mode are documented, riverine erosion is likely to initiate and be observed prior to
   being obscured by high water levels, and the levee is free of any obstructions that would cause concerns for identifying signs of potential poor
   performance or accessing the site with necessary equipment.

1. Sensors are embedded in levee to detect and warn of erosion occurring below the water level.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Riverine Erosion Unsuccessful Intervention

1. The embankment is constructed of material that would breach slowly, allowing extra time for detection and intervention.

## Levee/Floodwall Closures

There are a variety of different styles of closure systems used for access through the levee embankment or floodwall section when river levels are low
to normal. These closure systems must be set properly and in a timely fashion to prevent flood water from flowing through the access opening. The
most common types of closure systems include sandbag closures, soil piles with plastic sheets, soil baskets, stoplogs/bulkheads, post and panel style
closures, and moveable gates (swing, roller, miter, etc.). It is not uncommon to have multiple closure types within the same segment.

### Identifying a closure

Some closures may be difficult to identify since they may not show up in the plans as a formal closure. A closure simply may be a lengthy low spot in
the levee that requires a raise in elevation to match the adjacent non-levee structure or a road crossing that sits high up within the centerline but
requires an additional elevation increase by a temporary structure. If no formal closure is evident on the plans, the screening team should contact
the local sponsor to get more information. This needs to be considered in the context of the incipient overtopping location as well; thus, it is important
to coordinate with the local sponsor as it can have a significant impact on the risk evaluation.

An example of a closure that may be difficult to identify is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-127" />, where a road was designed to go over the
levee but sits lower than the adjacent wall and levee sections. It is shown as an “at-grade” crossing on the plans but would require some type of
temporary structure (such as sandbags) in order to reach the same elevation as the adjacent sections.

  caption="This closure—a road crossing through a levee—may be difficult to identify as a closure by looking at the plans. Note the higher elevations of the adjacent wall on the left and the embankment on the right."
/>

### Post-and-panel

Post-and-panel style closures usually include a series of panels that serve as the water barrier. The panels are supported by other structural
members, which, in turn, transfer the load to a floodwall or closure structure wall. A “traditional” post-and-panel style closure would have
horizontal panels supported by vertical posts embedded in a sill structure. This type of traditional post-and-panel closure is shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-128" />; included struts have been added to help support the load.

For the purposes of levee screening, post-and-panel closures also include those systems that use panels (spanning either horizontally or vertically)
supported by other structural load-carrying members such as girders, frame, etc., even if they do not meet the traditional definition of a
post-and-panel structure. For example, in <FigReference figKey="figure-129" />, steel panels are supported by the frame structure and horizontal
girders; <FigReference figKey="figure-130" /> shows a closure with vertical panels.

  caption="A post-and-panel closure with vertical panels and supporting members"
/>

### Stoplog or bulkhead

Stoplog or bulkhead style closures share many of the same characteristics as the post-and-panel style closures. The major difference is that
stoplog/bulkhead closures do not need intermediate vertical posts to help carry the hydrostatic load.

A typical configuration of a stoplog closure being set in place is depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-131" />.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-132" /> shows the steel panels for this closure structure in storage. The horizontal panels are lifted in place and
dropped down into the slots one on top of the other. Sandbags are usually used against the base of the closure to eliminate nuisance flow. The
hydrostatic load is transferred to the wall through the bearing face of the slots. The condition of the slots is an important consideration when
evaluating potential poor performance of stoplog/bulkhead closures for two reasons. First, from an alignment standpoint, the panels first must fit in
the slots and be able to slide vertically down on top of one another without getting wedged in place. Secondly, they must take the bearing load from
the panels. Since more load is transferred from the stop logs to the wall at the bottom due to increase water pressure, the structural condition of
the wall slots near the base is very important.

<Figure

  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure131.png"

  alt="Stoplog closure panels in storage."
  caption="Stoplog closure panels in storage."
/>

### Movable gate

Movable gate closures are those where the gate is essentially attached to the adjoining wall by some mechanism and moved into place. These include
swing gates, slide gates, roller gates, and other types. Most of these gates are small enough that they are moved manually, but there are situations
where machinery is used to set the closure.

An example of a slide gate on a levee is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-133" />. This gate is moved manually in place and slides along a track
located above the closure. It is locked into place by latching a lock mechanism.

<FigReference figKey="figure-134" /> shows a swing gate style of closure viewed from the land side of the floodwall. This swing gate pivots around a
vertical pin or rod and is manually swung into place to set the closure. It also has a latching mechanism within the adjoining wall section to hold it
in place once it is set.

A roller gate is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-135" />. This gate is moved into place by using rollers on an embedded track and is latched
once it is set in place.

Any type of gate closure that does not require assembly and can simply be moved into place should be considered a movable gate type of closure for the
purposes of levee screening. This includes gates that are moved by motors or some other type of powered mechanism. The screening team should verify
the condition of the latching mechanism to make sure it is good operating condition.

/>

### Sandbag

Sandbag closures are used on many flood protection projects. A typical sandbag closure is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-136" />. Sandbag
closures are known to be the most prevalent among the different types of closures because of there is little-to-no construction cost associated with
them at the time the levee was built. While this is a significant benefit during original construction, there are some serious drawbacks when it comes
to sandbag closures.

Sandbag closures can be slow to set in place depending upon the size of the closure and the number of people involved. It takes a lot of people to set
large sandbag closures in a reasonable amount of time. Volunteers are often called upon to accomplish this task. However, there is a specific way to
properly construct a sandbag closure and most volunteers are unaware of the proper procedures for placing and interlocking bags together. This has led
to performance issues with installed sandbag structures in the past.

  figKey="figure-136"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure136.png"
  alt="A typical sandbag closure at a road crossing"
  caption="A typical sandbag closure at a road crossing"
/>

### Soil pile and plastic sheet

Piling soil and covering it with plastic sheeting, shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-137" />, is a means of creating a temporary closure. The use
of Hesco<sup>TM</sup> baskets, TYPAR Geocells<sup>TM</sup> or similar/equivalent systems can be considered under this type of closure as well. These
are lightweight multi-cellular units that provide a barrier to floodwaters. They are filled with sand after being assembled on site to provide weight
and then the joints are covered with plastic sheeting. <FigReference figKey="figure-138" /> shows a Hesco<sup>TM</sup> basket flood barrier in Fargo,
ND.

  caption="HescoTM baskets being used as a flood barrier in Fargo, ND"

### Other Closures (Culverts, etc.)

There may be other items that function as closures in a levee segment that must be closed to prevent flow from entering the leveed area. The screening
team should use the “Other” category to include anything that acts as a closure but does not fit into one of the categories listed above.

A common example would be a culvert gate closure. The purpose of a culvert gate closure is to shut off flow from entering the leveed area when water
levels rise on the discharge side of the culvert. During normal operation, the gate closure is left open to allow the culvert to drain interior water
by gravity. However, when water is high on the discharge (flood) side, the gate closure is shut and interior drainage is usually sent to the flood
side by means of a pump station. The performance of the culvert gate closures is important because if they cannot be shut, the flood waters can enter
the land side through the culvert.

Several types of culvert gate closure configurations can be ignored during the levee screening effort due to their relatively low influence on
consequence estimation or their low likelihood of poor performance when compared to other performance modes. If any of the following criteria are met,
the culvert closure is considered a negligible risk contributor and does not need to be evaluated.

- The culvert’s cross-sectional area is less than 12 square feet (approximately 4’ diameter for circular gates).

- The culvert has two independent, positive means of closure.

- The culvert has a sluice gate in a gate well.

An example of a closure structure that <em>should</em> be included in the screening assessment is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-139" />, as
it has a large enough cross-sectional area that if it was not closed during a high flow event, water could backflow through it and cause significant
damage and possibly loss of life.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-139"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure139.png"
  alt="120-inch-diameter flap gate"
  caption="120-inch-diameter flap gate"
/>

When considering all closure types together, failure of closure structures represents one of the highest failure rates of all performance modes. There
have been over 30 documented breaches (or free flow) through open or partially open closure structures. Approximately ½ of these breaches were
sandbag closures. Most closure structure breaches have been due to the inability to set the closure successfully before the flood arrived.

### Closure System Event Tree

For closures systems, breach is defined as flow through an opening due to inability to successfully set the closure or due to failure of the closure
system after it is successfully placed ahead of the flood. For this reason, the closure system event tree and corresponding assessment is different from
the other performance modes in the LST. It does not follow the “initiation, continuation, progression” process that the other performance modes use.
Rather, it employs the event tree described below.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-140"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure140.png"
  alt="Closure Structure Event Tree"
  caption="Closure Structure Event Tree"
/>

As illustrated in the closure structure event tree, the first two nodes are related to whether the responsible party understands at the closure needs
to be installed and whether they can install it prior to water flowing through the opening. The third node takes into consideration whether the
closure system fails after being installed. The final node, like the other performance modes, considers the potential for intervention to prevent
flooding of the leveed area due to failure of an installed closure system.

Data from the LLID suggest that beach of closure systems due to not being installed in time is twice as likely as breach due to failure of an
installed closure.

### Closures - Flood Forecast

The first node in the event tree for closures is the flood forecast node. In short, the people responsible for installing closures must have a
reasonably accurate forecast to alert them that the closure needs to be installed.

For historic performance, screening teams should differentiate between whether failure to install a closure system historically was due to lack of
forecast or another reason. If another reason, that should be included under the next node. This node is specific to ability to forecast the need to
set a closure.

Special guidance on “Flood Forecast” – unlike nodes for other failure modes, screening teams are encouraged to select “very low likelihood” (VLL) for
flood forecast if information exists to provide a high level of confidence that a forecast will be available to identify that the closure structures
should be installed. This will be common.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Closures - Flood Forecast

The closure system was not set during historic events <em>due to the lack of forecasts being provided</em>, which allowed water to flow through the
opening. Nothing has changed that would improve the likelihood of a forecast being provided during a future flood event.

Stage forecasting capabilities are inadequate to predict water surface elevations that would require closure placement.

No closure installation plan exists that contains triggers for when closures systems should be installed.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” or “Very Unlikely” rating for Closures - Flood Forecast

Forecasts have been provided historically that provided teams necessary information to install closures.

A closure plan, including triggers, is documented and stage forecast capability is robust and unlikely to fail during high flow events.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Closures - Flood Forecast

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for Flood Forecast to be
successful or not.

### Closures – Placement Time

The next node for closure systems considers the amount of time that is available to set a closure relative to the amount of time necessary to set it.
Screening teams will need to justify ratings for this node based on the many factors described below.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Closures – Placement Time

1. There is insufficient time to mobilize personnel and equipment and to place closure.

1. An outside agency refuses to grant right-of-way entry (e.g., railroad).

1. An operating plan for closure placement does not exist.

1. Personnel are not fully aware that the closure needs to be placed due to lack of interagency coordination, knowledge of operating plan, trigger
   elevations, etc.

1. Necessary parts, supplies, and equipment are missing or are not easily accessible.

1. Personnel setting closure are inexperienced due to lack of flood fights or training.

1. Encroachments, accessibility issues, damage, debris, vegetation, or operational condition, prevents closure placement.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Closures – Placement Time

1. Closure structures have been installed successfully in the past and evidence exists that nothing has changed to reduce the likelihood that they
   would be installed successfully in the future.

1. Closure plan is well-documented and trial erections are completed on a regular basis.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Closures – Placement Time

Although triggers exist and flood forecasts are likely to be provided, the rate of rise in the stage is relatively rapid and the type of closure
structure available takes significant time to install (e.g. sandbags.)

### Closures – Structural Instability

Structural instability of the closure involves some type of failure of the closure system after it is successfully installed. This would involve a
failure of the individual pieces of the closure (bulkheads, etc.) or the supporting structure itself. As noted previously, failure after the closure
is successfully placed is significantly less likely that the likelihood of setting the closure ahead of the flood. That being the case, there have
still been documented incidents in the LLID where a failure of the closure system occurred after it was successfully placed. Each of these failure
incidents involved either a sandbag closure or a soil pile/basket closure.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Closures – Structural Instability

All documented failures of closure systems after being set in place have involved either sandbag or soil pile/basket failures that were improperly
installed. This included situations where sandbag walls collapsed under load and where the foundation supporting the weight of the sandbag closure
‘blew out’ due to excessive uplift pressures. Soil pile/basket collapses have occurred when the baskets were improperly stacked, and the foundation
couldn’t support the weight of the soil basket wall. Therefore, a “Likely” rating is applicable when there is little-to-no experience of the personnel
setting the closure, personnel are limited, and there is no recent history of successful performance under loading.

A “Likely” rating should only be applied to this node for other closure types (non-sandbag or soil pile/basket) where there are missing critical parts
or the structural pieces/supporting structure are known to be in poor condition with no recent history of good performance under load.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Closures – Structural Instability

An “Unlikely” rating should be applied for all closure types except sandbag and soil pile/baskets unless there are known structural issues as
described in the “Likely” rating section. An “Unlikely” rating can also be applied for sandbag and soil pile/basket closures when it is known that the
personnel setting the closure have sufficient experience with successfully setting the closures from either training or recent flood events and there
are ample personnel available to set the closure.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Closures – Structural Instability

A “Neutral” rating is applicable for those situations where there isn’t enough confidence to provide an “Unlikely” rating. For example, a “Neutral”
rating should be applied if there is likely to be sufficient personnel available to set the closure and there is a readily available manual that can
be followed, but the personnel setting the closure have no experience in setting the closure from recent flood events or training exercises. Another
example would be if a moveable frame closure needs to be placed and all parts are believed to be available and are secured in a safe storage facility,
but an inventory hasn’t been carried out in the last five years or there hasn’t been a successful setting of the closure from recent flooding or
training exercises. Each of these cases would most likely result in a successful setting and performance of the closure but there are enough
questions/concerns that a “Neutral” rating is warranted for screening purposes.

### Closures – Unsuccessful Intervention

The unsuccessful intervention node considers the likelihood that human efforts to detect and prevent a breach through the closure structure will not
work. There have been over 25 documented incidents where flood fighting actions were taken to prevent a breach through the closure. Most of these
successful flood fights involved plugging the flow through a large open culvert by means of a diver on the outlet end or other procedures. Others have
involved placing graded sand/gravel mix against the landside of the closure structure that was excessively leaking or it was questionable as to how
it was set in place. The ability to successfully flood fight a breach of an active closure structure is much less than other PFMs. This primarily
relates to the fact that once flow is moving through the closure, it becomes both difficult and dangerous to attempt and close it off; thus, success
is less likely than other PFMs.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

## Floodwall Types - Overview

Floodwalls are structural walls that are used to reduce the likelihood of inundation in areas. They are considerably more expensive to build on a
lateral per foot basis when compared to earthen embankments but are necessary when there is insufficient space for earthen levee construction. The
presence of floodwalls within the USACE levee portfolio is much less when compared to embankments. Approximately 20% of the segments within USACE have
a floodwall as part of the line of protection. When looking at the relative length of floodwalls compared to embankments, only about 3% of the line
of protection consists of floodwalls; however, floodwalls are commonly used in highly urbanized areas making their performance extremely important from
a risk perspective.

The USACE inventory contains a variety of floodwalls. Primary types are I-walls, also referred to as cantilever pile walls, and T-walls. I-walls
account for about 50% of the entire length of floodwalls evaluated as part of the LLID. T-walls account for approximately 42% of the overall length of
floodwalls within the portfolio. A much smaller percentage (8%) of the inventory consists of other types such as gravity walls, cellular structures,
braced walls, and others. These types of walls are classified together as ‘Other Floodwalls’ for the purposes of this document. In most cases, it is
not possible to determine the type of floodwall without a review of the as-built plans since they look the same above the ground surface.

An important term for floodwall evaluation is the stickup height of the wall. This is also referred to as the exposed height or loading height. This
is the height of the wall above the resisting side ground surface elevation at the wall/ground interface. It is shown as the term ‘Height’ in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-141" />. This will commonly be referred to as stickup height in this document.

<Figure

  alt="Floodwall stickup height (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
  caption="Floodwall stickup height (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

Much of the information within this document relative to floodwall failure modes, figures, and event tree information was taken from the recently
published USACE EM 1110-2-2502 “Engineering and Design of Floodwalls and Other Hydraulic Retaining Structures” dated August 2022. A re-write of EM
1110-2-2502, the previous version was published in 1989, was developed over several years as USACE transitioned to risk-informed design procedures.
The updated information in EM 1110-2-2502 was able to take in the lessons learned from floodwall performance during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with
particular emphasis on updated guidance related to I-walls. The reader is encouraged to review EM 1110-2-2502 if more information is desired relative
to floodwall design/analysis.

### I-walls (Cantilever Pile Walls)

In general, I-walls are used when the stickup height is relatively short, usually less than 10 feet, but slightly higher in some instances depending
upon site conditions. Various styles of I-walls can be found in the USACE inventory, including those shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-142" />.
The majority of I-walls in the USACE inventory are either Type II or sheetpile. A Type II I-wall is essentially a sheetpile I-wall with a concrete cap
placed above the ground line.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-142"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure142.png"
  alt="Examples of I-walls in the USACE inventory"
  caption="Examples of I-walls in the USACE inventory"
/>

### T-walls

T-walls represent a significant portion of the USACE inventory of floodwalls. A T-wall is so named because its cross-section looks like an inverted
‘T’. T-walls are considerably more expensive to build compared to I-walls. T-walls are typically used when the stickup height of the wall is too tall
for an I-wall or the foundation conditions warrant such a wall. T-walls are also commonly used to transition from a closure structure to an adjoining
I-wall/levee embankment section. Most T-walls in the inventory are considered free-standing, but about ¼ of them are supported by a deep foundation
system (load bearing H-piles or concrete drilled shafts) because of foundation conditions and/or loading requirements. A generalized loading diagram
for a free-standing T-wall with a stability key on the waterside edge of the base slab is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-143" />. A
free-standing T-wall with a waterside sheetpile cutoff wall is depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-144" />. The sheetpile cutoff is for
underseepage control only and is not an axial/lateral load bearing feature of the wall. Finally, a T-wall with deep foundation structural support
system is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-145" /> where the steel piles/drilled shafts are load bearing members and the sheetpile is a seepage
cutoff feature.

  caption="Pile-founded T-wall with sheetpile cutoff (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

### L-walls

An L-wall is a variation of a T-wall in which the toe of the structure (waterside portion of the base slab) is not present because of space
restrictions. L-walls can also be free-standing or pile founded. L-walls represent a relatively small percentage of the USACE floodwall inventory, but
they can be evaluated using the same procedures as T-walls due to their similar characteristics and performance.

### Other Floodwall Types

There are a variety of other floodwall types within the USACE inventory, but they make up less than 10% of the overall portfolio. These include
laterally braced/buttress walls, counterfort walls, gravity wall sections, sheetpile cellular walls, and others. A few examples are included herein
such as a braced/buttress floodwall (<FigReference figKey="figure-146" />) and a gravity wall (<FigReference figKey="figure-147" />).

## Types of floodwalls to be assessed for levee screening

Screening with the LST focuses primarily on two types of floodwalls:

- Floodwalls that serve as a boundary for a leveed area and are not part of a closure structure. A wall of this type is shown in
  {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-148" />.

- Transition walls that connect embankment sections and closure structures that have a stickup height greater than two feet. A wall of this type is
  shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-149" />.

It is important to identify exactly which part of the wall is to be assessed. For example, the sheetpile I-wall in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-149" /> serves as a transition from a levee embankment section to a roadway closure structure. The concrete portion
of this structure would be assessed under the closure structures performance mode, whereas the sheetpile section would be assessed as a floodwall.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-146"

  caption="Gravity monolith floodwall (FEMA 2013)."
/>

The floodwall assessment reflects the general levee screening program rule that the “worst case” governs the assessment, so it must be determined
which floodwall section will control the assessment when there are multiple walls or wall types within the same segment. All things being equal
(stickup height, foundation conditions, loading, etc.), I-walls are the most critical based upon historical performance. When presented with the same
wall type at multiple locations where foundation conditions and other considerations are similar, choose the wall section with the largest stickup
height for the evaluation. An evaluation of multiple wall sections may be required to determine which is more critical. It is important to document
the logic involved with selecting the controlling floodwall section for the evaluation.

## Types of walls that are not assessed for the floodwall performance modes

Do not assess the following types of walls for the floodwall performance modes—floodwall instability or floodwall underseepage:

- A transition wall with a stickup height less than two feet, regardless of wall type (I-wall, T-wall, etc.). See, for example, the wall in
  {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-150" />.

- A transition wall that is integral to the design of a closure structure such as when the wall incorporates an adjoining storage vault to hold the
  moveable closure structure pieces. In these cases, the wall and storage vault are structurally tied together as part of the overall closure structure.
  These walls would be assessed as part of the structural condition of the closure structure.

- Part of a closure structure, such as the concrete walls perpendicular to the levee embankment shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-151" /> that
  form the structural tie-in for the erectable closure pieces.

- Elements of gravity drainage and pump discharge structures, such as the unusual configuration shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-152" />.

- A wall that is retaining a portion of the levee embankment, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-153" />. The evaluator should determine if the
  wall serves as part of the water-retaining feature or simply ‘supports’ the embankment. If the latter is true, the wall in question is a retaining
  wall. The evaluator needs to determine the impacts a failure of this wall would have on the embankment. A retaining wall on the river side is under
  less demand during a flood than it is in drier conditions. Another detail to check is for the presence of weepholes; no true floodwall has weepholes,
  since they would allow floodwaters to penetrate to the leveed side.

## Floodwall Backward Erosion and Piping in Foundation (Floodwall BEP Foundation)

Based upon historic performance information collected as part of the LLID, floodwalls tend to perform better than embankments with respect to
foundation backward erosion and piping. There has only been one documented floodwall breach prior to overtopping in the collected historical data
associated with foundation underseepage and piping. This occurred in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina along the London Avenue Canal where an
I-wall section failed. There have been 24 documented incidents where significant flood fighting actions were taken to prevent a breach of the
floodwall due to excessive underseepage/piping.

First, many floodwalls have underseepage control systems (sheetpile cutoff walls and/or toe drains) as part of their design and construction. A
properly installed sheetpile cutoff wall will either significantly lengthen the seepage path or positively cutoff a thinner erodible layer in the
foundation. Reviewing the as-built plans and/or original construction photos is usually the only way to accurately determine if a sheetpile cutoff
wall was used in construction of the floodwall. Secondly, floodwalls with toe drains are commonly designed as if the toe drain does not exist in the
event it becomes blocked or loses efficiency over time. This provides an added layer of safety to the wall as part of the design. In addition, most
floodwalls within USACE portfolio were designed and constructed to USACE engineering standards at the time of construction meaning they had to meet
the required safety factors embedded into their design and certain construction tolerances. In short, they were engineered structures built to a
specific standard. There are a lot of levee embankments built by local interests that were either adopted into the USACE levee program or were simply
enlarged by USACE and then brought into the program; thus, a portion of the USACE levee embankment portfolio was not necessarily designed or constructed
to the same standards as floodwalls. Finally, floodwall sections have an inherent resiliency as individual wall monolith sections can safely carry
loads over small voids by spanning the gap in the foundation. Side friction between adjoining monoliths provides additional resistance to differential
wall movement as well.

### Determining the adequacy of floodwall underseepage control features

Most of the information relative to underdrainage systems from ‘BEP Foundation’ is also applicable to the foundation of floodwalls. Refer to that
section for additional information as necessary. The biggest difference compared to embankments when it comes to underseepage controls is that some
floodwalls incorporate sheetpile cutoff walls into their design/construction. This is typically done when a known pervious stratum exists below the
concrete base of the wall section. Many floodwalls incorporate a toe drain at the landside base of the wall to help control underseepage below the
wall (<FigReference figKey="figure-154" />). It is possible that both a sheetpile cutoff and toe drain are present. This may have been done as an
added safety measure, but not necessarily accounted for in the design. The most accurate way to determine the effectiveness a floodwall underseepage
system is an evaluation of past performance. It may be possible to have the toe drainage system tested for efficiency but that usually is only done
when there is evidence to suggest it isn’t functioning as intended.

### Vegetation considerations relative to floodwall underseepage

Root systems for large vegetation can have an adverse impact on floodwall underseepage and piping. This includes situations where tree root systems
can infiltrate toe drains and render them ineffective. The potential impacts of vegetation relative to underseepage is covered in detail in ‘BEP
Foundation’ and ‘Floodwall Instability’ sections of this document and is considered applicable to ‘Floodwall Underseepage and Piping’ as well.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-154"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure154.png"
  alt="Free-standing T-wall with toe drain at landside base of the wall."
  caption="Free-standing T-wall with toe drain at landside base of the wall."
/>

### Encroachment considerations relative to floodwall underseepage

Encroachments for a levee embankment or floodwall can take on many forms. Some can be damaging to underseepage, while others may not impact
performance but can block access or hinder inspections. Encroachments that shorten the seepage path or increase uplift forces below a floodwall can
cause significant performance issues especially when a sheetpile cutoff wall is not present to help control underseepage. This would involve any type
of encroachment where an excavation has occurred (landside ditch, swimming pool, building foundation, etc.) in the vicinity of the floodwall. An
excavation of this type may severely damage or fail a toe drain, relief well system, or other features important to the performance of the floodwall.
Many encroachments are made without USACE knowledge and aren’t uncovered until an inspection or flood event occurs. USACE can approve an ’authorized’
encroachment if the information is sent to the respective office, evaluated for its potential impact to the embankment/floodwall, and determined not
to be an issue with respect to performance, inspection, or flood fighting. The LST assessment team should conduct a review of any authorized
encroachments that have the potential to adversely impact performance. Historically, there have been many ‘authorized’ encroachments that were not
necessarily evaluated for performance but were allowed to be constructed.

### Culverts and pipes in the vicinity of floodwalls

The degradation and localized failure of culverts/pipes in the vicinity of floodwalls is known to have a negative impact on floodwall performance.
Often this manifests itself in the form of sinkholes that form during a flood event. Since floodwalls are prevalent in urban areas that were likely
developed prior to their construction, there is a very good chance that old, abandoned utility lines exist in the vicinity or foundation of the
floodwall that were not part of the project. The degradation of these pipes can provide an unfiltered exit point for foundation underseepage and
piping resulting in loss of foundation material. The underseepage and piping of material below a floodwall works together with the stability of the
floodwall. Damaged/failed culverts and pipes near floodwalls is one of the leading causes of floodwall distress and warrants careful consideration
when evaluating the performance of the floodwall under load from a flood event. It is important to work closely with the local sponsor or other entity
to develop an accurate as possible layout of all culverts and pipes in the vicinity of floodwalls. These include those associated with the project’s construction
and those not formally associated with the flood protection project. An example of significant distress is shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-155" /> where a network of large sinkholes formed landward of the floodwall due to collapsed sewer lines.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-155"

  alt="Network of sinkholes landward of floodwall (USACE, Memphis District)"
  caption="Network of sinkholes landward of floodwall (USACE, Memphis District)"
/>

### Sheetpile Material: Steel (Hot-Rolled, Cold-Formed), PVC, Fiberglass

Floodwalls commonly use sheetpiles as part of their construction. This could be for the actual wall itself (I-walls) or simply for underseepage
control (T-walls, L-walls). See the information for this covered under the ‘Floodwall Instability’ section of this document as it is applicable to
‘Floodwall Underseepage and Piping’ as well.

### Floodwall BEP Foundation event tree

The failure process for floodwall BEP foundation is similar to that outlined for embankment BEP Foundation, but there are some differences that are important
to document. An erodible material needs to exist below the wall and have a connection to the hydrostatic pressure from the waterside. There needs to
be an unfiltered or inadequately filtered exit to allow material migration to exit the seepage path. As erodible material is transported out of the
exit, there must be a layer than can hold a continuous roof over the erodible layer in order to develop the soil pipe. This could be either a cohesive
(confining) soil layer above the erodible layer or the base slab of the floodwall (such as a T-wall, L-wall, or gravity monolith section). As the
soil pipe works its way back towards the waterside, eventually there is a loss of load carrying ability for the wall/soil mass ultimately leading to a
breach. This scenario is depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-156" /> for a free-standing T-wall with no sheetpile cutoff. A couple of examples
of this type of failure for an I-wall is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-157" /> with the left side showing an I-wall on flat/natural ground
and the one on the right showing an I-wall embedded in an embankment. Underseepage and piping below an I-wall can lead to either a rotational type of
failure or a global instability (lateral displacement) failure.

  caption="I-wall underseepage and piping failure sequences (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

### Floodwall BEP Foundation: Initiation

There are three basic phenomena that must be in place for this failure to occur. First, there must be a continuous erodible layer located in the
foundation below the floodwall. This must extend continuously from the waterside to the protected side such that it is connected to the source.
Secondly, there needs to be an unfiltered or inadequately filtered exit at the end of the seepage path. Finally, there needs to be a sufficient exit
gradient to begin moving the erodible material out of the unfiltered or inadequately filtered exit.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on Floodwall U/S and Piping - Initiation

1. Past performance provides evidence of <em>harmful</em> seepage and/or piping of foundation material, such as when:

1. Landside areas of floodwall have been saturated, experience significant underseepage or cause major concerns requiring emergency stabilization
   measures. This includes evidence of sand boils moving foundation material or significant landside seepage in excess of what was anticipated as part of
   design. An example of this is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-158" /> where a large landside boil formed about 250-ft landward of the
   floodwall and other areas had experienced significant ponding of underseepage flow. <FigReference figKey="figure-159" /> illustrates another example
   where emergency stabilization measures were undertaken to control floodwall underseepage during a flood event.

  alt="Placement of emergency material to control active floodwall underseepage during flood event (USACE, Detroit District)"
  caption="Placement of emergency material to control active floodwall underseepage during flood event (USACE, Detroit District)"
/>

1. A history of sinkholes in relatively close to the floodwall, as shown <FigReference figKey="figure-155" /> and
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-160" />. Many times this is from a damaged culvert/pipe below the floodwall or a failed landside pipe located near
   the floodwall. As noted earlier, floodwalls are prominent in urban areas due to space restrictions and frequently there are utility lines located near
   floodwalls that are susceptible to collapse and opening an unfiltered exit for the seepage path below the wall. This is especially concerning when
   there is flowing water present in the sinkhole.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-160"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure160.png"
  alt="Sinkhole on landside of floodwall (USACE, Louisville District)."
  caption="Sinkhole on landside of floodwall (USACE, Louisville District)."
/>

1. The stratigraphy of the soils below the floodwall are likely to cause seepage problems and no underseepage control system (sheetpile cutoff, relief
   well system, toe drain, etc.) exists for the floodwall. If this situation exists, past performance should provide evidence of underseepage if the
   wall has experienced a significant enough flood loading (greater than 75% of the stickup height). It is also important to note that it is possible the
   floodwall has experienced a significant loading, but the performance simply wasn’t well documented. Just because there is no written or photographed
   evidence doesn’t necessarily mean there weren’t any issues.

1. The geomorphology/stratigraphy is such that underseepage is likely to occur and the design/construction of the wall accounts for this situation,
   but changes in condition of the features has occurred. An example of this is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-161" /> where a landside tree root
   system has penetrated the toe drain causing it to malfunction. An ineffective toe drain due to loss of efficiency would have a similar impact and
   warrant a ‘Likely’ rating as well. Another example would be if some type of unauthorized excavated encroachment (swimming pool, drainage ditch,
   building foundation, etc.) had been added near the toe drain or underseepage control system.

1. Other situations covered under ‘BEP Foundation’ section with respect to design/construction deficiencies, locations of previous damage areas, old
   channel/slough crossing locations, presence of encroachments (particularly landside excavations), animal burrows, and cracking are all considered
   applicable to floodwall underseepage as well.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-161"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure161.png"
  alt="Tree root system adversely impacting floodwall toe drain."
  caption="Tree root system adversely impacting floodwall toe drain."
/>

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on Floodwall U/S and Piping - Initiation

See the information covered under ‘BEP Foundation’ for ‘Neutral’ ratings with respect to initiation as it is also applicable to ‘Floodwall
Underseepage and Piping’. Basically, there isn’t strong enough evidence from past performance (either good or poor) under loading exceeding 75% of the
floodwall stickup height to draw any solid conclusions. Another example would be there is past performance evidence under loading exceeding 75% of
the wall stickup height, but potentially adverse factors (vegetation growth, toe drain condition, unauthorized encroachments, animal burrow activity,
etc.) have changed since the last event and it is not possible to conclude performance would be similar to the previous event due to these changes.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on Floodwall U/S and Piping - Initiation

1. Past performance indicates floodwall performed well under significant loading (greater than 75% of stickup height) with no evidence of adverse
   landside seepage and no significant changes to potentially adverse factors (vegetation growth, deteriorated pipes, etc.) since the last major flood
   event. Minor seepage is not a concern if it is easily controlled and there is no evidence of foundation materials having been moved (clear seepage)
   below the wall.

1. For situations where there isn’t reliable past performance under significant loading, the foundation stratigraphy is such that underseepage
   wouldn’t be expected to occur OR if underseepage was expected, then the underseepage control system (sheetpile cutoff wall and/or toe drain) is
   properly designed to account for it and is in good operating condition. If a cohesionless soil foundation does not exist, input a probability of 1E-06
   for the initiation node, describe the foundation conditions in the rationale, and input a probability of 0.5 (Neutral) for the remaining nodes with
   no rationale.

1. There are no old channel/slough crossings along the floodwall alignment that weren’t accounted for during original design and construction. This
   usually entails some type of underseepage control system within the reach of the old channel/slough crossing. A review of old channel/river alignment
   maps is likely required to determine locations of where channel/slough crossings are located relative to the floodwall alignment.

1. There are no excavations in the vicinity of the floodwall, animal burrows are not problematic and/or are actively managed, no signs of cracking in
   soil in area around floodwall and any underseepage control system is well designed, maintained, and in good working condition.

### Floodwall BEP Foundation: Continuation

The nodal estimate for ‘Continuation’ should be rated as ‘Likely’ since the unfiltered or inadequately filtered exit is part of the ‘Initiation’ node.
Three exit conditions (planar, horizontal, and crack/hole) are possible for backward erosion piping to occur. Planar is when there is an unfiltered
exit that occurs naturally (no confining layer at exit point). Horizontal is typically when the confining layer is removed primarily due to an
excavation of some type. Crack/hole location is where the integrity of the confining layer is no longer intact because of the presence of a crack,
penetration, animal burrow, tree, etc. See description under ‘BEP Foundation – Continuation’ for information relative to this node.

### Floodwall BEF Foundation: Progression

The ‘Progression’ node for this failure mode involves the ability for a soil pipe to form along the seepage path. There must be some feature
(confining layer, embedded structure, etc.) above the erodible layer that can hold a roof as the pipe develops and progresses. The likelihood of a
confining layer’s ability to hold a roof is a function of its cohesive properties. Soils with a high clay or silt content will assuredly hold a roof.
Some granular soils with minor amounts of clay/silt can also hold a roof under the right conditions. Embedded structures (base slab for a floodwall,
culvert/pipe, etc.) can serve as a roof for an underlying erodible layer. For more detailed information regarding this aspect of the ‘Progression’
node, please refer to the ‘BEP Foundation – Progression’ section of this manual.

The hydraulic conditions must also exist for this failure mode to progress. Hydraulic gradients within the foundation must remain high enough for a
long enough duration to allow the progression of the pipe back to the source. The gradient must be sufficient to move soil particles along the path
out of the unfiltered/inadequately filtered exit. Hydraulic gradient requirements are covered in the ‘BEP Foundation – Progression’ section of this
manual.

An additional consideration for this PFM that is specific to FW BEP Foundation is that enough material must be removed under the floodwall section in
order to cause a failure of the wall itself. This will be dependent upon the floodwall type and construction methods. Pile-founded walls will be the
most resistant to this type of failure due to their deep foundation system. Pile-founded wall sections should receive an ‘Unlikely’ rating for the
overall ‘Progression’ node unless there are other extenuating circumstances that warrant otherwise.

For floodwalls without a deep foundation system (pile-founded), gravity monolith walls and T-walls/L-walls should be much more resistant compared to
I-walls for situations where the wall has to span an opening in the foundation caused by BEP. The base slab or footing sections of these type walls
allow it to span a wider opening in the foundation compared to I-walls. When considering this node of the event tree for Floodwall BEP Foundation,
take into account the wall type, monolith length along the levee alignment and how individual wall monolith sections are structurally tied together if
applicable. If the opening below the wall is likely to exceed half the width of an individual monolith, then a ‘Neutral’ rating for T-walls, L-walls,
gravity monolith walls is warranted. A ‘Likely’ rating should be applied for I-walls in this situation. If the opening below the wall is less than ½
the width of an individual monolith, an ‘Unlikely’ rating is applicable for T-walls, L-walls, and gravity monolith walls. A ‘Neutral’ rating would be
applicable for I-walls.

### Floodwall BEP Foundation: Unsuccessful Intervention

See the information for this item under ‘Unsuccessful Intervention’ portion of the ‘BEP Foundation’ narrative as this node for ‘Floodwall Underseepage
and Piping’ is similar. The section describing the ability to detect and intervene is considered applicable as it relates to excessive vegetation
growth, presence of encroachments, availability of flood fight materials, land rights, etc. There also must be readily available access to the site
for the flood fight to be successful without flooded interior roads or other means to access the site. There have been many documented instances where
flood fight personnel noted in their reports that the site or area was inaccessible due to interior roads being flooded. This is an important
consideration when determining the likelihood of intervention being successful from both a detection and action standpoint.

Successful flood fighting for floodwall underseepage has a higher likelihood of success compared to floodwall instability. This is mainly because the
distress associated with floodwall underseepage can show itself before a collapse of the wall occurs unlike failure due to floodwall instability where
wall movement and collapse can be sudden and without sufficient warning time. As noted previously, there have been numerous documented incidents
where flood fight actions were taken to prevent a floodwall breach due to underseepage/piping. Many of these may have occurred prior to the
‘Progression’ node being reached in the event tree. The specifics of when certain actions were taken during the flood fight typically aren’t available
compared to exactly when certain levels of distress were noted. Typically, the type of flood fight is documented along with location and signs of
distress. Assuming there is ample warning time with respect to the onset of performance issues, adequate supplies/personnel and operational
experience, most flood fight actions have proven successful for floodwall underseepage and piping. The timing of when certain actions were taken is
uncertain in most instances due to the nature of flood fight reporting relative to actual distress.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating on Floodwall U/S and Piping - Unsuccessful Intervention

A ‘Likely’ rating on unsuccessful intervention is a negative rating, meaning the assessor does not think intervention will be successful. This could
be due to the ability to detect the problem, flood fight it if detected, or potentially both. One example warranting a ‘Likely’ rating for floodwall
underseepage and piping is depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-162" /> where it would be nearly impossible to detect any kind of problem with
the excessive vegetation against the wall. Additional consideration for ability to access the location where flood fighting would be required also
needs to be evaluated. A review of the necessary personnel and equipment to conduct the flood fight needs to be considered when determining the
applicable rating for this node. If either the physical access to the site or lack of available personnel/equipment is an issue of concern, then a
‘Likely’ rating for unsuccessful intervention should be applied. Other examples for a ‘Likely’ rating for this node can be found under ‘BEP Foundation
– Unsuccessful Intervention’ section of this manual.

  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure162.png"
  alt="Example of excessive vegetation along floodwall"
  caption="Example of excessive vegetation along floodwall"
/>

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating on Floodwall U/S and Piping - Unsuccessful Intervention

A ‘Neutral’ rating indicates that there is a high amount of uncertainty regarding the ability to successfully intervene prior to a full breach
occurring. An example of when this rating would be applicable would be if there is not a history of successful flood fighting and it is questionable
as to whether there are sufficient personnel available to conduct the flood fight in a timely manner.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating on Floodwall U/S and Piping - Unsuccessful Intervention

An ‘Unlikely’ rating is applicable when there is a history of successful flood fighting for the segment and local interests have the necessary
experience and personnel to conduct the flood fight in a timely manner. Access to the area should not be an issue nor should the availability of flood
fight materials and equipment. Even if there isn’t a history of successful flood fighting, but the local sponsor has a sound plan to flood fight and
has enough resources and time to address the issue then an ‘Unlikely’ rating would be justified. An example of a successful flood fight to prevent a
breach of a floodwall is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-163" /> where a gravel/sand mix was brought into the help control underseepage.
Emergency flood fighting was conducted just landward of the wall where distress was initially noted. Once that immediate area was stabilized, the
local sponsor had enough personnel, material, and experience to build a secondary emergency mixed material embankment around the building to limit the
damage in the event the floodwall failed catastrophically. The actions taken by the local sponsor prevented a failure from underseepage and
foundation/wall repairs were undertaken after the flood passed.

## Floodwall Instability

There are multiple types of floodwall instability failure modes depending upon the wall type and loads acting on the structure. T-walls and I-walls
make up over 90% of the USACE floodwall inventory so these will be covered in detail. Instability failure of other floodwall types will be touched
upon, but not covered to the extent of T-walls and I-walls.

Historically, T-walls have performed much better than I-walls based upon the information collected as part of the LLID. They are inherently more
stable than I-walls when it comes to resisting loads on floodwalls. There have been no documented failures of a T-wall prior to overtopping within the
USACE portfolio for the data collected to date. It is possible it has occurred, but it hasn’t been uncovered or documented as part of the on-going
research. In comparison, there have been multiple I-wall failures prior to overtopping with many of these occurring during Hurricane Katrina in New
Orleans. It is important to note that there were several T-wall sections in New Orleans that were loaded similarly to the I-walls during Hurricane
Katrina and none of those failed prior to overtopping. This is not to say T-walls can’t fail prior to overtopping, but their performance to date
indicates a much more stable structure compared to I-walls.

### I-wall (Cantilever Pile Wall) Instability Failure Modes

I-walls are the most common type of floodwall within the USACE portfolio making up approximately 50% of the overall USACE floodwall portfolio length
evaluated as part of LLID. There have been four documented failures of I-wall sections prior to overtopping from the historical data collected across
the USACE portfolio. Three of these occurred in the greater New Orleans area during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. The other failure was in the
Kingston-to-Exeter system along the Susquehanna River during flooding in September 1972 associated with Hurricane Agnes.

Prior to overtopping, I-walls can fail in three general ways with respect to floodwall instability: rotational failure of the wall, global instability
of the wall/soil mass, or a failure of the structural elements of the wall (sheetpile section, concrete cap, or the sheetpile/concrete cap
connection). The stability of an I-wall is generated from passive soil resistance. Force equilibrium is developed through the balancing of forces
between the hydrostatic pressure and active/passive soil pressures. A general scheme depicting the active and passive soil loading zones on an I-wall
is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-164" />. It is possible for the wall to move laterally as opposed to rotational if the passive resistance of
soils on the lower section of the wall is less than the upper layers, such as when a lower layer is soft or has high piezometric pressure.

1. <em>I-wall Rotational Failure</em>. The rotational failure of an I-wall occurs when the lateral forces exceed the passive resistance of the soil to
   the point that wall begins to bend or rotate towards the landside. This ultimately results in lowering of the top of the wall and potential
   overtopping from the water source. Overtopping flow will next erode the resisting side soil providing the passive resistance further reducing the load
   carrying ability of the wall until it finally collapses. This type of failure is depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-165" />. A similar loading
   mechanism for this wall is wave over splash where the wall could be stable for the still water loading to the top of the wall, but the waves
   splashing over the top of the wall erode the soil providing the passive resistance until enough of it is removed and causes a rotational failure. This
   scenario is shown from a storm event in <FigReference figKey="figure-166" />. Rotational failure is usually the dominant floodwall instability
   performance mode for I-walls unless there is a soft lower layer that exists below a stiffer upper layer.

1. <em>I-wall Global Instability Failure of Wall/Soil Mass</em>. A global instability failure of an I-wall occurs when the driving forces caused by a
   combination of hydrostatic and soil pressures result in shear stress in the soil mass exceeding the shear strength of the soil. This, in turn, results
   in a slip surface forming along a continuous plane below the wall. This mechanism also lowers the crest of the wall and results in overtopping and
   subsequent breach, scour of the landside soil, and ultimately collapse of the wall section. This type of failure can occur in I-walls where a softer
   lower layer within the floodwall foundation exists below a stiffer upper layer. This situation could allow the buildup of high pore water pressures
   within the softer lower layer to the point the wall foundation becomes unstable as a result of very low effective vertical soil stress on the
   resisting side. This failure scenario is depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-167" />, or it could also be combined with a soil mass/wall
   rotational type failure.

  caption="Global instability failure of wall/soil mass (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

1. <em>I-Wall Strength Failure</em>. A strength-related failure of the I-wall occurs when any of the elements of the wall (sheetpile, concrete cap,
   connection, etc.) become overstressed due to excessive loading. The overstressed location can occur below the ground surface making observation of the
   failure initiation impossible until noticeable movement of the wall occurs. Waterstops between adjoining monoliths would likely begin to rupture with
   visible signs of leakage as the wall experiences differential movement. This failure also results in a lowering of the top of the wall until it
   overtops and ultimately collapses.

### Free-Standing T-wall Instability Failure Modes

There are multiple potential failure modes for a free-standing T-wall, but they can essentially be broken into two broad categories: global
instability and strength-related failures. Global instability refers to sliding, rotational (overturning), and bearing capacity failures of the
overall wall/foundation section. Global instability failures can occur before or after overtopping of a floodwall. If the floodwall holds and then
overtops, passive resistance on the protected side can be eroded away leading to global instability. Schematic images for each of the global
instability failure modes of a free-standing T-wall are depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-168" />, <FigReference figKey="figure-169" />, and
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-170" />.

  caption="Global instability bearing capacity failure (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

Strength-related failure modes for a free-standing T-wall are caused by either excessive moment and/or shear forces acting on the structure. The
moment and shear forces acting on the structure need to be resisted by the floodwall. Moment resistance (capacity) is primarily supplied by steel
reinforcement within the wall section. Shear capacity is provided by the concrete and reinforcing steel. Typically, the critical location is where the
base slab meets the wall stem. <FigReference figKey="figure-171" />depicts a strength-related failure of a T-wall at this location.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-171"

  caption="Strength failure for a free-standing T-wall (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

### Pile-Founded T-wall Instability Failure Modes

Pile-founded T-walls are typically used when the combination of anticipated loading and foundation conditions warrant the need for such a system. The
load bearing piles are usually either steel H-piles or concrete drilled shafts. The stability of the overall pile-founded system comes from the
lateral and axial resistance of the load bearing piles. T-walls, as well as L-walls, with pile foundations can fail in a variety of ways. Potential
failure modes include an axial failure of the pile system, lateral displacement of the pile system, global instability of the pile foundation,
strength-related failure of the wall section (similar to <FigReference figKey="figure-171" />), fracturing/yielding of the piles, and a failure of
the pile/concrete base slab connection. In general, pile-founded T-walls are very stable structures that should not present a performance issue prior
to overtopping. Even with a moderate amount of overtopping, they have historically performed very well relative to other wall types.

### Other Floodwall Instability Failure Modes

As previously noted, less than 10% of the floodwalls within USACE portfolio consist of wall types other than an I-wall or T-wall (free-standing or
pile-founded). Other floodwall types consist of gravity monolith (free-standing/pile-founded), sheetpile cellular structures, braced/buttress walls,
and others. Failure modes for these types of walls vary by wall type and will need to be handled on a case-by-case, site-specific manner for
screening.

### Specialized Load Cases for Floodwall Instability – All Floodwall Types

There are a couple of unique floodwall instability load cases that may need to be considered for specialized situations. One is when a floodwall is
along a navigable canal or an area where barges or ships are moored that have the potential to break loose during flood/hurricane events. Stray
barges/vessels can become unmoored due to high winds, surge, or excessive flow and strike floodwalls located in the vicinity of the barge/vessel. This
has happened when hurricane and other coastal events impact an industrial region where there are a lot of port/terminal facilities. Another example
would be when a large tree near a floodwall is uprooted and overturns onto a floodwall. A large enough tree toppling onto a floodwall can cause a wall
failure. It is not possible to develop failure sequences for every scenario. When a unique situation arises as part of the floodwall evaluation, the
assessment should be handled on a case-by-case, site-specific manner in a manner consistent with LST screening procedures.

### Determining the adequacy of floodwall underseepage control features

See information covered under this item for ‘Floodwall Underseepage and Piping’ as it is considered applicable to ‘Floodwall Instability’ as well.
Floodwalls within the USACE portfolio utilize a variety of underseepage control systems such as sheetpile cutoff walls, toe drains, and relief well
systems. Some of these systems (toe drains, relief wells, etc.) can lose their efficiency over time. Their effectiveness can play an important role in
the stability of the floodwall. An increase in underseepage caused by a deteriorated/damaged underseepage control system may generate the necessary
forces to destabilize the wall.

### Culverts and pipes in the vicinity of floodwalls

Floodwall instability and underseepage/piping are interrelated and the condition of culverts/pipes/utility lines in the vicinity of floodwalls can
play an important role with respect to performance. The potential for a deteriorated culvert/landside pipe/utility line to shorten the seepage path
and reduce the effectiveness of the soil surrounding the wall has led to performance related issues requiring flood fighting. Most of this has already
been covered under ‘Floodwall Underseepage and Piping’ performance mode and is consistent with this performance mode as well.

### Vegetation considerations relative to floodwall stability

Trees, brush, bushes, vines or other significant vegetative growth immediately adjacent to either side of a floodwall have the potential to adversely
affect floodwall stability. Large vegetation must be a ‘safe distance’ from the foundation of the wall. Unfortunately, it is not possible to prescribe
a safe distance that will account for all situations. Each must be judged in the context of the situation being assessed. Most, but not all, of the
performance issues associated with vegetation and floodwall stability relate to a tree uprooting in the vicinity of the wall and adversely impacting
the external loads on the wall itself. Therefore, vegetation with respect to floodwall stability is generally concerned with large trees and/or trees
with extensive root systems adjacent to floodwalls. Smaller vegetation adjacent to floodwalls (brush, bushes, vines, etc.) is less threatening, but
can have an adverse impact when it comes to access, inspection, and flood fighting.

When large trees and/or vegetation with significant root systems are located near floodwalls, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-172" />,
consider the following:

- Trees with large root systems extending below floodwalls have the potential to lift the wall, potentially causing a wide range of performance issues
  such as cracking, separation of joints, or wall movement.

- Large trees adjacent to walls can potentially topple onto a floodwall and cause significant structural damage or failure of the wall. This usually
  corresponds to when the ground is saturated and high winds are present.

- The underseepage control system for the floodwall can potentially be damaged either by tree roots penetrating the drainage system or by having an
  uprooted tree dislodge the drainage system, rendering it ineffective. This has the potential to increase uplift pressures acting on the wall.

- Floodwalls that require passive resistance for stability can fail if a large soil mass on the land side is removed by an overturned tree.
  Overturning of trees usually occurs when the ground is saturated and high winds are present. Both conditions likely co-exist with flood events
  particularly as it relates to coastal storms (hurricanes, tropical storms).

### Considerations relative to potential design/construction deficiencies

Floodwalls have historically performed well when significantly loaded apart from a few different instances. When performance under loading has caused
issues, one of the dominant contributing factors relates to a pre-existing design or construction deficiency. This was an unknown issue at the time of
design/construction in many cases. An example of this is the performance of some I-walls in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. The formation of
the gap at the interface between the floodwall and soil mass surrounding it for cohesive soils in the undrained condition resulted in development of
full hydrostatic pressure on the face of the wall down to the depth of the gap. The I-wall/soil mass system was not designed for this type of loading
and multiple wall sections failed prior to overtopping as a result of this design oversight. Recently updated guidance for all floodwall design and
analysis (USACE EM 1110-2-2502 dated August 2022) should help alleviate this situation as these lessons learned have been incorporated into
design/analysis procedures. Important considerations relative to design/construction deficiencies include, but not limited to, the following:

- The evaluator(s) needs to thoroughly review the original design load cases that were used to build the wall floodwall and any updated analyses that
  have been undertaken since construction. Most I-walls within the USACE portfolio went through a phased evaluation process after Hurricane Katrina
  based upon their characteristics. This information should be reviewed and referenced when considering the performance of the wall under load. This
  also includes floodwalls that are embedded within embankment sections. Traditional earth pressure theories may not be applicable as they do not
  consider varying ground elevations that exist in levee embankments. Slope stability procedures can be used but have limitations. Full numerical
  analysis is the preferred methodology for instances where walls are embedded within levee embankments.

- Foundation soil types and engineering properties are a very important consideration relative to floodwall performance. This should have been
  accounted for in the original design, but the importance was further highlighted during Hurricane Katrina. Soft foundations materials with potential
  to experience high piezometric pressures during loading can be problematic if not properly accounted for in the design and construction. Fat (highly
  plastic) clays can also be problematic because their potential to swell and cause different movement between wall sections.

- There have been instances where floodwall instability and/or seepage related problems have occurred when the foundation materials were not constructed
  according to the design. Examples of this have included situations where construction debris, waste, tree stumps, etc. have been discovered buried
  below the floodwall. The only way this may be uncovered is if there is a performance related issues, but it is noted here because of the information
  was uncovered as part of the LLID research and it has occurred on multiple projects.

- Some existing floodwalls constructed by local interests have been adopted into the USACE program or portions of the walls were modified/added upon
  to meet required elevations. This is an important design/construction consideration relative to potential performance. There have been multiple
  instances of performance related issues of old wall sections that were adopted into the program and turned out to be inadequately designed. It is important
  to consider what actions or modifications were taken by USACE when the existing wall was adopted into the USACE levee portfolio and if the design
  properly accounted for the updated requirements.

### Encroachment considerations for floodwall instability

Encroachments near floodwalls can have a wide range of impacts as it relates to floodwall stability. These can range from performance issues to the
inability to access, inspect, and flood fight if necessary. The most damaging encroachments from a performance standpoint are those involving
excavations immediately adjacent to the floodwall that remove any soil required for passive resistance. This can have combined negative impacts for
both floodwall instability and underseepage/piping. There are instances where materials (<FigReference figKey="figure-173" />) have been piled
against the landside of a floodwall. While this could help with floodwall performance during a flood event, it should only be temporary in nature and
after the flood passes should be removed for access and inspection. It is obvious from the image in the photo that this business stores their
materials against the wall as part of the normal day-to-day operations which isn’t recommended. This is an encroachment that should not have
‘authorized’ or ‘permitted’ due to the inability to inspect the floodwall.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-173"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure173.png"
  alt="Gravel and sand piled up against floodwall"
  caption="Gravel and sand piled up against floodwall"
/>

### Sheetpile Material: Steel (Hot-Rolled, Cold-Formed), PVC, Fiberglass

Floodwalls commonly use sheetpiles as part of their construction. This could be for the actual wall itself (I-walls) or simply for underseepage
control (T-walls, L-walls). The construction material for the sheetpile is usually steel. Steel sheetpiles can be constructed through a hot-rolled of
cold-formed process. Hot-rolled steel sheetpiles provide superior relative performance from a structural load resistance, interlock strength, and
overall integrity standpoint. The tighter interlocks in hot-rolled sheet piling provide greater resistance to seepage. Hot-rolled sheetpiles also
provide greater ability to share loads laterally when there is either unequal loading or an unforeseen weak zone in the foundation along the length of
wall. Most floodwalls that utilize sheetpiles within the USACE portfolio are likely constructed with hot-rolled sheetpiles, but this should be
verified as part of a floodwall evaluation. There was a period (late 1980’s to early 2000’s) where the construction industry was producing cold-formed
sheetpiles when domestic mills were not rolling many hot-rolled sheets. It is possible some cold-formed steel sheetpiles were used in USACE projects
during this period. As per updated EM 1110-2-2502, USACE does not allow the use of cold-formed steel sheetpiles in the construction of new critical
floodwalls without specialized consultation and approval with HQUSACE. When conducting an evaluation for a floodwall that was built with cold-formed
steel sheetpiles, it is very important to consider the lower strength and seepage control properties when compared to hot-rolled sheetpiling.

Other materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and fiberglass resin composite exist for construction sheet piling. These have been used in light
duty applications for earth retaining walls and have the positive attribute of not having corrosion-related issues; however, these types of piling
have much lower strength, stiffness, interlock capacity, and seepage control characteristics when compared to hot-rolled steel sheetpiles. EM
1110-2-2502 also notes these materials should not be used for construction of new critical floodwalls without specialized approval and authorization
by HQUSACE. If an existing floodwall that has these materials is being evaluated, it is extremely important to consider this information when
assessing the integrity of the wall under load.

## I-wall Instability Event Trees

The three potential failure modes for floodwall instability of I-walls (rotational, global instability, and strength) have been combined into
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-174" />. The loading node for each PFM represents the annualized probability associated with loading to the top of
the floodwall. This will be site-specific for each floodwall, but in each case the failure sequence initiates as a head difference forms across the
wall/soil mass section leading to lateral/driving forces being applied to the wall. For most I-walls, rotation instability will be the critical
floodwall instability failure mode unless there are soft/loose soil layers present within the wall foundation or there is some known defect
(corrosion, interlock issues, etc.) with the wall itself.

### I-wall Instability – Initiation

Each I-wall instability PFM starts with loading from the waterside being applied to the wall and some type of reaction from the wall itself. This is
summarized for each PFM within <FigReference figKey="figure-174" />:

<Figure
  figKey="figure-174"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure174.png"
  alt="I-wall event tree nodes for floodwall instability PFMs."
  caption="I-wall event tree nodes for floodwall instability PFMs."
/>

- <em>Rotational Instability</em>. The wall begins to rotate in a semi-rigid manner about the point of rotation located below the resisting side
  ground surface. This node should be given assigned a ‘Likely’ rating since wall movement is required to generate the necessary resisting forces for
  stability.

- <em>Global Instability of Wall/Soil Mass</em>. Loading causes a vertical force to be applied to the waterside soil mass. A ‘Likely’ rating for the
  ‘Initiation’ node should also be applied for this failure mode as it too requires movement to generate passive resistance forces.

- <em>Strength Failure</em>. Loading causes the sheetpile section or reinforcement within the concrete cap section to be overstressed and yield. This
  would only occur if the wall was not adequately designed/constructed or changing conditions (corrosion, general wall deterioration, etc.) has taken
  place and reduced the load carrying capability of the I-wall. An example of significant wall deterioration is shown in
  {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-175" />. Example of severely deteriorated floodwall. This would a situation where a ‘Likely’ rating for initiation
  of a strength failure is warranted.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-175"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure175.png"
  alt="Example of severely deteriorated floodwall"
  caption="Example of severely deteriorated floodwall"
/>

### I-wall Instability – Continuation

Once wall movement has initiated, it must continue to the point that force equilibrium is reached through additional displacement into the resisting
soil side. This ‘Continuation’ node for each I-wall instability failure mode is summarized as follows:

- <em>Rotational Instability</em>. Soil on resisting side experiences an increase in load from wall movement. As load and wall movement increase, full
  passive pressure develops near ground surface on resisting side.

- <em>Global Instability of Wall/Soil Mass</em>. As load increases, shear stresses within the soil mass supporting the wall begin to reach shear
  capacity of soil mass.

- <em>Strength Failure</em>. The top of the I-wall begins to visibly rotate toward the resisting side.

#### Factors that support ‘Likely’ rating for I-wall instability - Continuation

1. <em>Past performance.</em> As is the case with all other failure modes, past performance is usually a good indicator of future performance if the
   loading has been significant (greater than 90% of wall stickup height for I-walls) and the environmental characteristics have not changed. If there
   has been evidence of noticeable wall movement, significant distress or flood fighting during past flood events, then a ‘Likely’ rating for
   ‘Continuation’ should be applied. This is especially true if it occurred at less significant loading events. Signs of distress include significant
   seepage through wall joints, leaning of floodwall during/after a flood event, development of structural cracks in the concrete portion of the wall as
   a result of the flood, or differential wall movement between floodwall sections.

1. <em>Embedment Depth/Wall Height Ratio.</em> The embedment depth-to-wall height ratio provides a rough indication of I-wall stability performance
   based upon research conducted by USACE following Hurricane Katrina. <FigReference figKey="figure-176" /> shows a graphical representation of this for
   different soil types. Embedment depth represents the depth that the wall is embedded below the resisting side ground surface. The water height can be
   taken as the wall stickup height when assessing this for the LST since the wall is being evaluated for performance with water at the top. As shown in
   the figure, softer soils (London Ave Canal, E99 Soft Clay, Soft Clay) require deeper embedment depths relative to stickup height in order to generate
   their stability. This requires more lateral movement of the wall into the resisting soil mass to generate sufficient passive pressures. Stiffer soils
   (Tell City OC Clay, Nevada Sand, St. Paul Sand) require less displacement to fully mobilize their passive resistance. Any wall/soil configuration
   where the embedment depth-to-water height ratio that results in an estimated 2 inches (or greater) of lateral displacement into the resisting side
   soil using <FigReference figKey="figure-176" /> as a guide warrants a ‘Likely’ rating for ‘Continuation’.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-176"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure176.png"
  alt="Lateral displacement at resisting ground surface vs. embedment depth/water height ratio (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
  caption="Lateral displacement at resisting ground surface vs. embedment depth/water height ratio (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

1. <em>Accounting for Potential Gap at Soil/Wall Interface.</em> As per EM 1110-2-2502, lateral soil and/or water pressures acting on an I-wall tend
   to cause rigid body rotation of the top of the wall towards the resisting side. If the wall is founded in cohesive soil(s), a gap will form between
   the wall and soil on the waterside whenever hydrostatic pressure exceeds the active pressure associated with the soil. This is akin to a tension crack
   and is applicable for undrained soil conditions. There were I-walls that failed in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina as a result of this
   phenomena. It is important to note that saturated granular soils physically cannot support a gap. If a free-draining layer exists below the cohesive
   soil layer, then the gap can’t extend beyond the top of the free-draining layer. The I-wall should have been designed (or analyzed post Katrina) for
   both drained and undrained conditions and for gap/no gap conditions. If the I-wall has cohesive soils within the foundation and was not designed (or
   analyzed post Katrina) for all applicable load cases, an assessment rating of ‘Likely’ is appropriate for ‘Continuation’ unless other information
   suggests otherwise.

1. Resisting Soil Mass Changes. Resisting side soil is a key factor when it comes to achieving force equilibrium; thus, the stability and displacement
   of the wall is sensitive to the resisting side soil ground surface elevation. If this elevation has been altered since due to waterside erosion,
   encroachments/modifications, or other causes, a ‘Likely’ rating is applicable unless the updated embedment depth to water height ratio for the
   resisting soil mass still results in an estimated lateral displacement less than 1.5 inches as taken from <FigReference figKey="figure-176" />.

1. I-walls Founded in Embankments. Floodwalls embedded within levee embankments require special consideration. Traditional earth force computation
   methods may not be applicable due to varying ground conditions, such as slopes on a levee embankment. The failure surface is more akin to a slope
   stability, as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-177" />. Specialized analysis procedures (full numerical analyses) are best for these situations.
   If this was not done as part of the design or post Katrina analysis, an assessment rating of ‘Likely’ may be warranted unless information is
   available to suggest otherwise.

1. Erodibility of Waterside Wall/Soil Interface. Walls that are oriented at an angle with the direction of flow or located along a bend in the river
   are likely to see more scour damage than those running parallel with it. This is due to the presence of eddies and other abnormal flow patterns as the
   water changes direction. The same is true for any large trees or encroachments located near floodwalls that might re-direct water in a way that is
   more damaging from an erosion/scour standpoint. It is also common for scour damage to occur in the vicinity of bridge crossings over the river or
   stream. It is common for debris to get trapped on the bridge piers during a flood redirects flow into the adjoining levee. The waterside face of these
   floodwalls should have scour protection present to minimize erosion damage and undermining of the floodwall. Scour damage is a function of several
   factors. Velocity and duration interact with other factors such as soil erodibility, compaction methods, grass cover, revetment, and orientation of
   the wall. The faster the flow, the more likely scour damage will occur. Similarly, the longer the flow occurs against the wall, the more likely that
   erosion initiates somewhere along the wall and then progresses. Duration is also important for the failure mode to progress. The various combinations
   will place some walls in more favorable environments to resist erosion damage and others in situations where scour along the base of the wall is
   almost guaranteed. <FigReference figKey="figure-178" /> provides a rough guide for helping determine the appropriate effect associated with waterside
   scour.

  caption="I-wall failure planes for embedment in levee embankment (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

1. <em>Other Contributing Factors.</em> There are several other factors that can contribute to a ‘Likely’ rating as site-specific conditions warrant.
   These would include the presence of known damaged culverts/landside pipes in the vicinity of the floodwall, deteriorated underseepage control systems,
   known design/construction deficiencies, large trees with extensive root systems likely impacting wall underseepage or passive resistance, and others.
   Each of these needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as to how they would adversely impact floodwall instability.

  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure178.png"
  alt="Waterside scour guide for floodwall instability"
  caption="Waterside scour guide for floodwall instability"
/>

#### Factors that support ‘Unlikely’ rating for I-wall instability - Continuation

1. Past performance. If the I-wall being evaluated has been loaded to greater than 90% of its stickup height in the past and the performance was well
   documented with no signs of distress or flood fighting, a rating of ‘Unlikely’ is appropriate for ‘Continuation’. This assumes there have been no
   significant changes to other potential contributing factors since the last loading event that exceeded 90% of the stickup height.

1. Embedment Depth/Wall Height Ratio. When past performance can’t be used to assess ‘Continuation’ due to lack of a well-documented, significant load
   history OR there have been changes to other contributing factors since the last event, the embedment depth/wall height ratio can be used as an
   approximate indicator of performance. If the embedment depth/wall height ratio is such that estimated lateral displacement is less than 1.5 inches
   using <FigReference figKey="figure-176" /> as a guide, then ‘Unlikely’ is considered appropriate for ‘Continuation’.

1. Stiff/Hard Soils and Flat Ground. I-walls founded in stiff/hard soils and flat natural/engineered ground with no underlying soft zones have tended
   to perform well under loading. This factor goes with the embedment depth/wall height ratio information but can be used as a guide when the exact
   embedment depth is unknown, and the wall has been loaded to at least 75% of its loading stickup height with good historical performance. A rating of
   ‘Unlikely’ can be applied for ‘Continuation’ in these situations.

1. Adequate Design and Construction. I-walls that haven’t been loaded to 90% of their stickup height with well documented performance that have
   potentially loose/soft layers within their foundation can still receive an ‘Unlikely’ rating for ‘Continuation’. This would be the case if the wall
   has been designed (or analyzed post Katrina) using the latest load cases, methodologies from the August 2022 version of USACE EM 1110-2-2502 and meets
   all safety factor criteria.

### I-wall Instability - Progression

The next nodal estimate for I-wall instability is ‘Progression’. This node is typically the point where distress of the wall/soil mass itself is
noticeable. The ‘Progression’ node for each I-wall instability failure mode is documented as follows:

- <em>Rotational Instability</em>. The loading continues to increase causing full passive pressure to develop at lower elevations of resisting ground
  surface as wall continues to rotate.

- <em>Global Instability of Wall/Soil Mass</em>. The loading increases until the shear stresses in the soil mass exceed the soil shear strength along
  a continuous slip plane.

- <em>Strength Failure</em>. Continued rotation of wall ruptures adjoining monolith waterstops causing visible flow through joints or interlock seams.

#### Factors that support ‘Likely’ rating for I-wall instability - Progression

1. <em>Past performance.</em> See information under ‘Continuation’ node relative to past performance as this is also applicable for ‘Progression’.

1. <em>Permeable Foundation Layers. </em>Soil layers within the foundation that allow increased pore water pressure to warrant a ‘Likely’ rating for
   this node unless modifications or analysis has confirmed it not to be an issue. These zones have a potential to destabilize the entire wall/soil mass
   system.

1. <em>Wave Oversplash.</em> Since the LST is an evaluation for water to the top of the wall, the potential for wave oversplash (not still water/surge
   overtopping) is an important consideration for I-wall instability. Scouring of the resisting side soils can lead to a situation where stability of
   the wall becomes questionable due to loss of supporting soil. I-walls where sustained, damaging wave oversplash has the potential to occur and the
   resisting side soil is an erodible material (sand, silt, sand/silt mix, etc.), a rating of ‘Likely’ is applicable unless a scour protection system
   (concrete pad, heavy riprap, etc.) exists on the landside of the wall. This scenario is depicted in <FigReference figKey="figure-179" />. A ‘Likely’
   rating is also warranted if the sustained wave oversplash has a long enough duration to fail a wall founded in less erodible material (clay, silt/clay
   mix) where no erosion protection is present.

   ‘Progression’.

1. <em>I-walls Founded in Embankments</em>. See information under ‘Continuation’ node relative to past performance as this is also applicable for
   ‘Progression’.

#### Factors that support ‘Unlikely’ rating for I-wall instability - Progression

1. <em>Past performance.</em> See information under ‘Continuation’ node relative to past performance as this is also applicable for ‘Progression’.

1. <em>Wave Oversplash.</em> When wave oversplash duration is short for erosion resistant soils, or an erosion protection system (such as concrete
   splash pad, heavy stone protection, or other sufficient measures) is in place, a rating of ‘Unlikely’ for ‘Progression’ is warranted.
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-166" /> shows an example of this situation where the oversplash is significant, but a concrete pad has been placed
   landward of the wall to prevent/minimize erosion of the resisting side soil.

1. <em>Adequate Design/Construction.</em> If reliable performance information for load exceeding 90% of the stickup height isn’t available or not
   applicable, the design/analysis of the I-wall will need to be referenced to determine the appropriate rating for ‘Progression’. When the design (or
   analysis post Katrina) indicates the wall will perform satisfactorily and meets all safety criteria loading conditions outlined in USACE EM
   1110-2-2502, an ‘Unlikely’ rating is should be applied for the ‘Progression’ node.

  caption="Wave oversplash erosion damage (USACE, EM 1110-2-2502)"
/>

1. <em>Other Contributing Factors.</em> There should be no significant change in other potential contributing factors (vegetation, culverts/pipes,
   underseepage control systems, etc.) since the last significant loading event or when the design/analysis was completed for an ‘Unlikely’ rating to be
   applied for the ‘Progression’ node.

### I-wall Instability – Unsuccessful Intervention

The ‘Unsuccessful Intervention’ node considers the likelihood that human efforts can detect and successfully stop the failure process related to the
performance mode being evaluated. This is very difficult for floodwall stability since the failure likely would manifest itself in a very swift manner
as the loading reaches a level that exceeds the capacity of the wall/soil mass system. Most documented incidents where flood fight actions were taken
to prevent a failure due to floodwall instability were done early in the flood stage and were preventative in nature. Some of these can be
significant and thought of as actions taken to prevent a breach, but there hasn’t been a confirmed situation documented where there was active
movement of the wall on-going and it was ‘stabilized’ after it moved during the flood event.

In the absence of other information, a rating of ‘Likely’ should be applied for ‘Unsuccessful Intervention’ associated with floodwall instability. The
potential exists that wall movement could halt itself long enough for intervention actions to take place, but this seems very unlikely for loading to
the top of the wall. By the time the ‘Progression’ node is reached, the wall has already started to noticeably rotate/translate towards the resisting
side. This has the effect of lowering the top of the wall such that water would begin flowing over the lowered wall section. Intervention for
floodwall instability would most likely have to occur before any movement occurs when loading is well below the top of the wall. This becomes more of
a preventative measure as compared to heroic intervention.

Although the evaluation is for water level at the crest, consider whether intervention efforts are likely to start at lower stages and be implemented
by the time water reaches the levee crest.

## Free-Standing T-wall Instability Event Trees

Other than I-walls, free-standing T-walls are the second most common type of floodwall within the USACE portfolio making up about 1/3 of the total
length of floodwalls evaluated as part of the LLID. Potential failure modes for free-standing T-walls with respect to floodwall instability are as
follows: global instability (sliding, overturning, bearing capacity, wall/soil mass instability) and strength-related failure (excessive
moment/shear). The event tree sequence for each of these failure modes is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-180" />. Like the event trees for
I-walls, each sequence is initiated by a head difference forming across the section due to increasing loads from waterside of the wall.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-180"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure180.png"
  alt="Event Tree Failure Sequences for Free-standing T-walls."
  caption="Event Tree Failure Sequences for Free-standing T-walls."
/>

### Free-Standing T-wall Instability – Initiation

T-walls are different from I-walls in how they develop their force equilibrium. An I-wall relies on some amount of displacement into the resisting
side soil to generate enough passive pressure to resist the driving loads; thus, I-walls are usually rated ‘Likely’ for ‘Initiation’ of floodwall
instability except for the strength-related failure mode. The geometric shape of a T-wall allows it to generate stability through a combination of
resisting soil pressures, soil and water weight acting on the base slab, and frictional/shear resistance forces along the base slab/foundation
interface at or near the base of the wall. Shear/stability keys at the heel of the wall are added many times to further increase stability for a
free-standing T-wall.

#### Factors that support ‘Unlikely’ or ‘Very Unlikely’ rating for Free-Standing T-wall instability - Initiation

<em>Past performance.</em> The past performance of free-standing T-walls prior to overtopping within the USACE portfolio has been exceptional. There
has never been a known, documented free-standing T-wall failure prior to overtopping for all the wall sections evaluated to date as part of the LLID.
This is due to their inherent stability coupled with sound design/construction practices. Past performance of the entire portfolio of free-standing
T-walls provides enough evidence that an ‘Unlikely’ or ‘Very Unlikely’ rating for floodwall instability ‘Initiation’ is warranted. A ‘Very Unlikely’
rating should only be applied if the design of the free-standing T-wall indicates all safety factor criteria is met/exceeded AND the wall has
performed well under significant loading (greater than 75% stickup height loading) with no signs of distress or changes in secondary contributing
factors. Otherwise, an ‘Unlikely’ rating should be applied for ‘Initiation’ unless there are structural, foundation, or other concerns as outlined for
a ‘Likely’ or ‘Neutral’ rating.

Situations supporting a rating of ‘Likely’ or ‘Neutral’ for Free-Standing T-wall instability - Initiation

1. <em>Structural Deterioration of the Wall</em>. There may be some instances where ‘Initiation’ associated with a free-standing T-wall floodwall
   instability may warrant a rating other than ‘Unlikely’ or ‘Very Unlikely’. One example would be when the wall is in a deteriorated condition.
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-181" /> shows what appears to be a significant structural crack through the T-wall as viewed from the top.
   Additional investigation into this type of crack is warranted in terms of finding out more about its history and if the wall has been significantly
   loaded (greater than 75% of stickup height for a free-standing T-wall) with the crack in its current condition. This situation may warrant a rating of
   ‘Neutral’ or ‘Likely’ for ‘Initiation’ as it relates to floodwall instability. Note that small superficial cracks are not considered significant from
   a structural performance standpoint.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-181"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure181.png"
  alt="Significant structural crack of a free-standing T-wall"
  caption="Significant structural crack of a free-standing T-wall"
/>

1. <em>Existing Wall Misalignment</em>. There are situations where adjoining wall monoliths are misaligned, as shown in
   {"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-182" />. The cause of this misalignment may be sound reasoning for applying a rating other than ‘Unlikely’ or ‘Very
   Unlikely’ for floodwall instability. There should be a review of information to determine the cause of the misalignment. It is important to determine
   if the wall has been significantly loaded since the misalignment was noted and how it performed under such loading. If the wall movement was known to
   be due to a loading event, a rating other than ‘Unlikely’ is applicable unless remedial work has been done to stabilize the wall with an updated
   analysis. Note it is not uncommon to have slight misalignment between monoliths when a T-wall abuts an adjoining I-wall section or there is an abrupt
   change in alignment of the wall itself.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-182"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure182.png"
  alt="Misalignment between adjoining floodwall monoliths"
  caption="Misalignment between adjoining floodwall monoliths"
/>

1. <em>Damaged or Inefficient Underseepage Control System</em>. Underseepage control systems (relief wells, toe drains, sheetpile cutoff walls) are
   commonly included as part of a free-standing T-wall design. These can lose their efficiency over time or can be damaged by landside encroachments,
   tree roots, or other external causes. If the T-wall is reliant upon these systems for stability and they are known or suspected to be a
   damaged/deteriorated condition, a rating of ‘Neutral’ or ‘Likely’ should be applied depending upon the severity and the wall’s reliance upon the
   system for stability.

1. <em>Inadequate Waterside Scour Protection</em>. See the information for this under ‘I-wall Instability – Continuation’ as it is similar for
   free-standing T-walls. Situations where inadequate waterside scour protection exists for T-walls will warrant a ‘Likely’ or ‘Neutral’ rating for
   floodwall instability as it relates to ‘Initiation’.

1. <em>Old Channel/Slough Crossing</em>. If the free-standing T-wall has not been loaded greater than 75% of its stickup height and it crosses an old
   channel/slough or river alignment location, a rating of ‘Likely’ or ‘Neutral’ is warranted if this the crossing wasn’t properly accounted for in the
   design of the wall. Old river alignment maps should be consulted as a guide. Additional underseepage and stability design/construction features are
   usually required at old channel/slough crossings that should be noted in the as-built plans.

1. <em>Other Contributing Factors</em>. If other contributing factors are a concern and could potentially impact the performance of the free-standing
   T-wall with respect to stability, a rating of ‘Likely’ or ‘Neutral’ is applicable with an explanation for the rating.

### Free-standing T-wall Instability – Continuation

Once a free-standing T-wall reaches this point in the event tree, it is already in a state of distress. A rating of ‘Likely’ is applicable for
floodwall instability unless there is justification for a different rating. The justification should be well documented.

### Free-standing T-wall Instability – Progression

This node of the event tree represents distress to the point the wall is just shy of complete failure. There is no history of T-wall failures prior to
overtopping to draw upon for experience so performance is predicated upon loading and resistance theories. Sliding, overturning, bearing capacity and
the strength-related failure modes all involve displacement of the wall for this node to occur. The global instability of the wall/soil mass failure
is essentially to the point of failure along the slip surface.

#### Factors supporting a ‘Neutral’ Rating for Free-standing T-wall Instability – Progression

Due to the lack of free-standing T-wall instability distress incidents, a rating of ‘Neutral’ for ‘Progression’ should be applied unless there is
evidence to support otherwise. There is a reasonable chance that failure will continue to progress unless action is taken to stabilize the wall as
part of intervention.

#### Factors supporting a ‘Likely’ Rating for Free-standing T-wall Instability – Progression

1. <em>Waterside Scour at Floodwall/Ground Interface</em>. Waterside scour can cause undermining and instability of a floodwall if action isn’t taken
   to stabilize the wall (intervention). If the waterside scour is a contributor to the ‘Initiation’ of the failure mode and the flood event has
   sufficient duration to increase/deepen the waterside scour, it can lead to progression of floodwall instability. A rating of ‘Likely’ is warranted for
   ‘Progression’ under this scenario. Sufficient duration is a function of the length of the flood event, erodibility of the soil mass on the waterside
   of the wall, presence of ‘good’ vegetative cover, and the presence of any erosion protection (riprap, revetment, etc.) in place prior to the flood
   occurring.

1. <em>Structural Deterioration of Wall</em>. If the existing condition of the wall is questionable such that ‘Initiation’ was given a rating other
   than ‘Unlikely’ or ‘Very Unlikely’, a rating of ‘Likely’ is warranted for ‘Progression’ unless there is justification for otherwise. If the wall is
   significantly deteriorated prior to the flood occurring and the event tree has progressed to this point because of the wall’s condition, it is
   reasonable to assume it would progress to failure without some level of successful intervention (which is covered indirectly in the event tree node
   following ‘Progression’).

1. <em>Underseepage Control System</em>. If the free-standing T-wall is reliant upon the underseepage control system for stability based upon design
   calculations and the condition of the that system is ineffective, a rating of ‘Likely’ is applicable for ‘Progression’ unless recent (previous 5
   years) past performance from a significant loading event (greater than 75% stickup height) justifies otherwise. Keep in mind that some free-standing
   T-walls are designed with the underseepage control system as an added safety measure such that the wall is not necessarily reliant upon it for
   stability. This is important to consider as part of the evaluation when determining the rating even if the system is damaged.

1. <em>Other Contributing Factors</em>. A contributing factor (encroachment, culvert/pipe, animal burrows, etc.) that has a significant enough
   influence to initiate the failure process for a free-standing T-wall is probably sufficient to contribute to the failure mode progression. Thus, if
   the ‘Initiation’ node is rated as ‘Likely’ or ‘Neutral’ because of an adverse contributing factor, a similar rating should be applied for
   ‘Progression’ unless there is justification for a different rating. This justification should be well-documented.

### Free-Standing T-wall Instability – Unsuccessful Intervention

See information for ‘I-wall Instability Unsuccessful Intervention’ with respect to this node for free-standing T-walls as it also applicable.

## Pile-Founded T-wall and Other Floodwall Event Trees

As noted earlier, I-walls and free-standing T-walls make up most (approximately 80%) floodwalls within the USACE portfolio. Pile-founded T-walls (and
L-walls) account for about 10% of the floodwall portfolio. Other floodwall types (gravity monoliths, braced/buttress walls, sheetpile cells, etc.)
account of the other 10%. Since both pile-founded T-walls/L-walls and other floodwall types represent a minor portion of the portfolio, development of
project-specific event trees is recommended for their evaluation. These project-specific event trees should have a combined five nodal estimates to
account for the following:

- Initiation

- Continuation

- Progression

- Unsuccessful Intervention

- Breach

## Overtopping - Embankment

Overtopping flow leading to erosion of levee embankment is one of the primary risk drivers for most levees. There are two reasons for this: 1) the
majority of levees have an overtopping ACE (which is synonymous with AEP in this case) of less than 0.2%, or 1/500, as shown in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-183" /> and; 2) many levees are not designed to withstand overtopping flow. Note: data in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-183" /> are specific to those levees in the USACE portfolio, but most levees outside the USACE portfolio have a
lower ACE than those within the USACE portfolio, which means they would overtop more frequently on an annual basis.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-183"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure183.png"
  alt="Overtopping Annual Chance Exceedance for Levees in the USACE Portfolio (USACE 2018)"
  caption="Overtopping Annual Chance Exceedance for Levees in the USACE Portfolio (USACE 2018)"
/>

The mechanics of embankment overtopping erosion and breach are illustrated in <FigReference figKey="figure-184" /> and
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-185" />. The numbers in the figures correspond to time steps in the progression of erosion.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-184" /> shows overtopping erosion of a cohesionless soil embankment by progressive surface erosion (sediment
transport). The erosion occurs on a uniform but gradually flattening slope. At time step 2, the flattened slope has advanced to the floodside crest
resulting in breach. <FigReference figKey="figure-185" /> shows overtopping erosion of a cohesive or compacted cohesionless embankment by headcut
migration (formation and migration of a vertical or nearly vertical drop or headcut). Initial overtopping flow results in sheet and rill erosion, with
one or more master rills developing into a series of cascading overfalls that develop into a large headcut on the landside slope. The headcut
migrates from the landside to the floodside crest of the embankment (Hanson et al. 2005). Breach occurs at time step 4 when the headcut reaches the
floodside crest.

  figKey="figure-184"

<Figure

  alt="Overtopping erosion and breaching of cohesive soil embankment (NRCS 2011)."
  caption="Overtopping erosion and breaching of cohesive soil embankment (NRCS 2011)."
/>

In general, the most erosive flow occurs on the downstream slope, where the velocity is highest and where the slope makes it easier to dislodge
particles and move them away. On embankments that have been overtopped by floods, severe erosion has often been observed to begin where sheet flow on
the slope meets an obstacle, such as a structure or a large tree; a break in slope occurs; a change in material type, or vegetation is not uniform, or
soil is bare creating local turbulent flow. Areas where vegetation has been removed or sparse, the erosion will proceed to attack the soil directly
until a headcut or overfall is formed. Erosion generally continues in the form of "headcutting," progressing toward the levee crest that can
eventually reach the river. Predicting whether breach initiation and formation will occur can be a complicated procedure.

While levees have been overtopped by a few inches to more than a foot without breaching, information from the Levee Loading and Incident Database
(LLID) shows that about 60% of all levees breach when overtopped by a foot or more, but that varies significantly by the type of soils of which the
levee is made as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-186" />.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-186"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure186.png"
  alt="Probability of Breach during Overtopping for Different Depths and Soil Types."
  caption="Probability of Breach during Overtopping for Different Depths and Soil Types."
/>

As shown in the embankment overtopping erosion event tree (<FigReference figKey="figure-187" />), the potential for breach during overtopping is
dependent on the quality and type of erosion resistant material covering the landside embankment slope (e.g. vegetal cover), erosion susceptibility of
embankment material, and depth and duration of the overtopping flow.

Unlike other failure modes, flood fighting efforts to prevent breach during overtopping occur prior to this failure mode initiating. To be consistent
with other failure modes, the default event tree in the LST shows unsuccessful intervention as the last node, but the assessment team should rate it
as if it was the first node. The order of the event tree does not impact the quantitative results.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-187"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure187.png"
  alt="Embankment Overtopping Erosion Event Tree"
  caption="Embankment Overtopping Erosion Event Tree"
/>

<strong>Note:</strong> Unlike nodes for the other failure modes, which are rated with consideration of levee being loaded to the top. The embankment
overtopping erosion failure mode should be rated with consideration that the levee is being overtopped by 1 foot for a duration that is appropriate
for the levee system in question.

Pavement on the levee crest may be of some value in slowing erosion of materials once the headcut reaches the crest but should not be expected to
affect initiation. Depending on the depth of the headcut, the headcut can undermine pavement leading to a mass wasting of the pavement material as
cantilevered section collapse into the headcut. The Joso levee breach in September 2015 is a good example of how pavement along the levee crest slowed
the erosion process (<FigReference figKey="figure-188" />), but the levee ultimately failed and lead to mass evacuation and two people losing their
life.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-188"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure188.png"
  alt="Overtopping embankment erosion slowed by road pavement"
  caption="Overtopping embankment erosion slowed by road pavement"
/>

### Embankment Overtopping Erosion – Initiation

<strong>Note</strong>: Intervention efforts to raise the crest prior to overtopping must be considered before evaluating the initiation node.
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-189" /> can be used to help estimate how high the embankment could be raised with sandbags only for the required
length of levee and flood forecast if a plan, personnel, and equipment are available. <em>The crest raise that is likely to be successful becomes the
crest elevation for all subsequent nodal evaluations and for all other PFMs</em>. The overtopping performance of the modified embankment must be
evaluated considering any crest raise (which could modify the overflow characteristics) and/or slope armoring, and the resulting overtopping annual
exceedance probability of the raised crest must be reflected in the overtopping loading function.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-189"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure189.png"
  alt="Pyramid sandbag placement for crest raise"
  caption="Pyramid sandbag placement for crest raise"
/>

The initiation node assesses the likelihood that flow overtopping the levee (during an event that overtops the levee by 1’) will be sufficient to
remove any vegetation (or other resilient features such as stone armoring) that may exist and start eroding the levee embankment soil.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion Initiation

1. The levee has experienced overtopping erosion during historic overtopping events, regardless of whether is ultimately breached, and nothing has
   changed that would prevent erosion during future overtopping events.

1. The landside, or dry side, of the levee lacks consistent vegetal cover or other slope protection, and the embankment is erodible or moderately
   resistant (Hanson and Simon 2001).

1. The landside of the levee has erosion resistant material (vegetal cover or other slope protection), but the velocity (shear stress) and duration of
   overtopping is likely long enough to remove the slope protection and initiate erosion.

1. Knickpoints in the slope or protrusions into the flow (such as trees, bushes, or telephone poles) create locally turbulent flow for erosive attack
   of the embankment.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion Initiation

1. The levee has overtopped historically, there is documentation that no damage to the levee embankment occurred, and nothing significant has changed
   to the levee embankment slope protection that would make initiation of erosion more likely.

1. The levee has a well-maintained, designed overtopping section that would prevent breach during a major overtopping event.

1. The levee has armoring or slope protection that is able to withstand the overtopping depth and duration.

1. The levee embankment at the identified incipient overtopping location has well-maintained slope protection, is constructed of erosion-resistant
   soils (clay), and is free from obstacles or discontinuities that would encourage turbulent flow patterns.

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion Initiation

A Neutral rating is reserved for those situations where there is no strong evidence available to rate the potential for Embankment Overtopping Erosion
to initiate as Likely or Unlikely. This is typically caused by unknowns regarding the engineering characteristics of the embankment, construction
methods, limited load history, or the influence of contributing factors.

### Embankment Overtopping Erosion – Continuation

Once initiated, erosion will continue unless the eroding forces are reduced or a zone of erosion-resistant material is encountered. The only reason to
rate the continuation node for Overtopping Erosion something other than Likely would be if there is an embedded non-erodible feature in the levee
(e.g. a cutoff wall or sheet pile wall) or the core of the levee is constructed of non-erodible material.

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion - Continuation

The continuation node should be rated Likely unless one of the items listed under Unlikely or Neutral exist.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion – Continuation

1. A cutoff wall or sheet pile wall is embedded in the levee embankment at the identified incipient overtopping location, that would prevent
   headcutting from reaching the levee crest. An example of this is shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-190" /> where a steel sheet pile has been
   embedded in the embankment to cut-off seepage, but could also act to prevent erosion during an overtopping event from breaching the crest of the
   levee.

1. The core of the levee is made of an erosion-resistant material (clay) while the shells are erodible. Note: Zoned embankments are rare for levees.

<Figure
  figKey="figure-190"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure190.png"
  alt="Steel sheet pile embedded in embankment"
  caption="Steel sheet pile embedded in embankment"
/>

#### Factors that support “Neutral” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion – Continuation

The levee crest is covered with erosion resistant material (e.g. paved road) that could impede the headcut from intersecting the levee crest until
overtopping flows stopped.

### Embankment Overtopping Erosion – Progression

The progression node for overtopping erosion considers whether overtopping flows will last long enough for the erosion or headcutting process to
breach the levee crest. The screening team must weigh the duration of the flood event against the physical dimensions and embankment material of the
levee at the incipient overtopping location to rate the progression node.

Narrow, highly erodible embankments subject to long duration flood events would warrant a “Likely” rating while wide embankments made up of erosion
resistant materials subjected to short duration events would warrant an “Unlikely” rating.

### Embankment Overtopping Erosion – Unsuccessful Intervention

Unlike other PFMs, flood fighting efforts to prevent breach during overtopping occur prior to this PFM initiating. The screening team should consider
activities that would occur prior to overtopping when rating this node even though it is the last node in the LST.

The unsuccessful intervention node considers the likelihood that human efforts to detect and stop (or slow) the overtopping erosion process from
breaching the levee embankment fail to work. This node evaluates the potential that two activities will occur: 1) detection (i.e., whether, or when,
the developing failure mechanism would be identified as a potential problem); and 2) the ability to successfully intervene (i.e., can mitigating
efforts be implemented in time to stop or slow the failure process to the point where breach does not occur?).

<strong>Note</strong>: Efforts to raise the levee prior to overtopping should not be considered in the unsuccessful intervention node. See Initiation
node for additional details on how to handle crest raise. Only consider the likelihood of armoring the slope prior to overtopping for this node.

With a good understanding of the levee profile and likely overtopping locations, combined with good river stage forecasts, efforts can be made to
protect the levee embankment slope as shown in <FigReference figKey="figure-191" />. However, once overtopping erosion has initiated, little can be
done to prevent it from leading to breach other than the water receding in the river (either naturally or due to human efforts).

<Figure
  figKey="figure-191"
  src="figures\web-applications\lst\users-guide\v1.0\figures\figure191.png"
  alt="Overtopping slope protection (California DWR Emergency Flood Fighting Methods)"
  caption="Overtopping slope protection (California DWR Emergency Flood Fighting Methods)"
/>

#### Factors that support “Likely” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion - Unsuccessful Intervention

A likely rating on unsuccessful intervention is a negative rating, meaning the assessor does not think intervention will be successful. Generally, a
rating of Likely should be used unless strong justification exists as to how detection will occur and intervention will be successful.

1. The incipient overtopping location is unknown.

1. Stage forecasting ability is inadequate to provide time to flood fight due to overtopping.

1. Presence of vegetation, encroachments, or other items that make it difficult to flood fight.

1. Intervention protocols are not documented in O&M Manual and EAP.

1. Equipment and personnel are not available to reinforce areas prior to overtopping occurring.

#### Factors that support “Unlikely” rating for Embankment Overtopping Erosion - Unsuccessful Intervention

An unlikely rating on unsuccessful intervention is a positive rating that will significantly reduce the probability of breach, meaning the assessor
believes that intervention (i.e. flood fighting) will be successful.

1. Intervention has successfully prevented breach in the past <em>for this failure mode</em> and conditions have not changed significantly since that
   experience (e.g. experienced owner/operator, necessary materials are still available, etc.). Importantly, if intervention was successful for minor
   (&lt 1’ of overtopping) events, the team should consider whether the length and/or number of overtopping locations during an event that would overtop the
   levee by 1’ at the incipient overtopping location would reduce the likelihood of successful intervention.

1. Monitoring plans and flood fighting protocols for temporary armoring of the levee at the incipient overtopping location are documented. The levee
   is free of obstructions, and necessary materials and personnel are available.

## Overtopping - Floodwall

Floodwalls often have superiority over embankment sections in levee systems, meaning overtopping is more likely to occur along the levee embankment
section than the floodwall. However, if the levee consists only of floodwall, or if the floodwall section is identified as the incipient overtopping
location, then the potential for breach of the floodwall section after overtopping must be evaluated. Floodwalls have performed better than
embankments with respect to overtopping based upon the information collected in the historical performance dataset. There have been 60 documented
overtopping incidents associated with floodwall sections with 10 of these resulting in a failure of a floodwall section after overtopping occurred.
Nine of the ten floodwall overtopping failures were I-wall sections that had no scour protection system in place at the floodwall/landside ground
surface interface at the time of the flood event. Thus, the most critical case for floodwall overtopping will be when an I-wall section is overtopped
and there is no landside robust scour protection (concrete paving, heavy riprap, asphalt road, etc.) where the water plunging over the wall impacts
the ground. The evaluator must determine the type of floodwall section that will be overtopped and then default breach probabilities will be used by
the LST based upon the information collected from the historical performance data. If it is an I-wall section without a robust scour protection system
on the landside of the wall, a breach probability of 0.28 will be assigned. All other floodwall sections will be assigned a breach probability of
