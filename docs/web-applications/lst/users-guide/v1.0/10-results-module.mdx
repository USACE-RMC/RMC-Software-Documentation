# Results Module

## Purpose of this module

The Results module provides users the ability to view an assortment of results generated by the LST. As with the Computations module, the Results
module is only for viewing output, there are no options for entering or manipulating data. The Results Module, displayed in
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-203" />, is dividing into four sub-tabs:

- Annual Probability – displays results for Annual Probability of Failure (APF) and Annual Probability of Inundation (API). APF is also referred to as
  annual probability of breach.

- Expected Annual – displays results for Expected Annual Life Loss (EALL) and Expected Annual Damage (EAD). EAD values are specific to damage to
  property, including structures, contents, and vehicles.

- Levee Risk – displays risk results associated with poor performance of the levee, including potential breach prior to overtopping or during
  overtopping. These are the results that inform the levee safety action classification (LSAC), traditionally plotted on an f-N chart.

- Flood Risk – displays risk results for flood risk, which is levee risk plus risk associated with overtopping without breach (a.k.a. non-breach
  risk).

As discussed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 7, the LST computes three types of risk: levee risk, non-breach risk, and flood risk (
{"\n"}<FigReference figKey="figure-204" />). The term flood risk is used to describe the risk of flooding in the area behind the levee regardless of
what led to that flooding. For the purposes of the LST, flood risk does not include potential flooding from direct rainfall within the levee. It only
includes levee risk and non-breach risk. The term levee risk is used to refer to the risk due to potential poor performance of the levee itself, which
has historically been referred to as incremental risk. Non-breach risk is the risk due to capacity exceedance if the levee was “unbreachable”,
meaning the potential for poor performance of the existing levee was zero, and the only risk was due to overtopping without breach.

## Computation version

The computation version is displayed in the upper right corner of the Results module. Each time the LST receives an update that changes the results,
the computation version will be incremented upward. The example in <FigReference figKey="figure-205" /> shows the Computation Version is 2, which
matches the latest update to the LST computation approach.

The computation version used for a given screening will only be updated when something changes to force the LST computation to run (e.g. change
something on the Performance tab). It can only be updated for unlocked screenings. Users can see how computation updates change the results by
selecting different computation versions from the dropdown menu if the screening was created when a previous computation version was active. A
description of each computation update is provided on the Help tab.

## Results Based on Marginal Probabilities versus Adjusted Probabilities

Some of the LST results displayed in the Results module are based on marginal system response curves, and some are based on adjusted system response
curves. Both are useful, depending on the goal of the assessment. Displaying the results based on the adjusted system response curves will indicate
which outcomes should be considered first because they pose the greatest risk. For example, internal erosion through the embankment and overtopping
with breach failure modes could both be actionable for a levee. The internal erosion failure mode might be prioritized first because it is more likely
to be realized. The overtopping erosion failure mode could be less likely due to the presence of the internal erosion failure mode. The most
efficient path to risk reduction would come from addressing internal erosion first followed by overtopping erosion. However, addressing the internal
erosion failure mode will make overtopping with breach more likely when looking at results based on adjusted system response curves from a competing
risk model.

Marginal risk estimates for each failure mode are calculated and portrayed in the Levee Risk tab using marginal probabilities of failure for each
failure mode (See Step 1 in Chapter 7 for more information on Marginal SRPs). These estimates provide a simple and consistent means to identify
actionable failure modes, support scoping of additional studies, and formulation of risk reduction alternatives.

## Tabs in the Results Module

### Annual Probability

The Annual Probability tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-205" />) of the Results Module displays the following:

- Annual Probability of Failure (APF) for each failure mode. The APF is the probability of a levee breach or malfunction/improper operation of levee
  system components in any given year.  Sometimes also referred to as annual probability of breach.

- Annual Probability of Overtopping without Failure. Levees can overtop without failing, meaning they do not breach and the only water that enters the
  leveed area is due to capacity exceedance (overtopping) of the levee.

- Annual Probability of Inundation. The probability that flooding occurs due to levee breach or overtopping in any given year considering the full
  range of possible annual floods. The annual probability of inundation is the annual probability of breach prior to overtopping plus the annual
  probability of overtopping with and without breach.

- % Contribution. This provides a quick way for the user to identify the risk driving failure mode. For % contribution to breach, it is calculated by
  dividing the APF for the given failure mode by the total annual probability of breach. For % contribution to annual probability of inundation, it is
  calculated by dividing the annual probability for the given scenario by the total annual probability of inundation.

The results shown in the Annual Probability tab of the Results module are computed in Step 3 (see Chapter 7: Computations Module for more
information). <em>The annual probabilities in this sub-tab are based on the competing risk adjusted system response curves</em>, which means they
correspond to actual outcomes.

### Expected Annual

The Expected Annual tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-206" />) of the Results Module displays the expected annual consequence results, either
Expected Annual Life Loss (EALL) or Expected Annual Damage (EAD), for each failure mode as well as for levee risk, non-breach risk, and total flood
risk. Expected annual consequence, whether it be life loss (EALL) or property damage (EAD), describes the average annual consequences that would be
expected considering the full range of potential events and their likelihood to occur. It is the long-term average consequence estimate for the
assessed condition.

Levee risk expected annual consequence is the sum of all the failure modes listed above it in the table. Flood risk expected annual consequence is
levee risk plus the non-breach risk. <em>All results displayed in the Expected Annual tab are based on adjusted system response probabilities</em>.
Refer to Step 6 in the Computations chapter (Chapter 7) for more information on how expected annual consequences are computed.

The charts at the bottom of the Expected Annual tab provide a visual to help people understand the contribution of non-breach risk to the overall
flood risk in the leveed area. Non-breach risk shows the lowest risk that can be achieved through structural remediation of the existing levee.
Structural remediation in the case would include fixing any flaws identified with the levee that could lead to breach prior to overtopping but does
not include raising the levee.

Importantly, the non-breach risk displayed on the Expected Annual tab does not include the impact of potential consequence management measures (e.g.
improved evacuation planning). So, while the non-breach risk illustrates the lowest achievable flood risk in the levee area through structural
remediation measures, the risk could be lower if non-structural measures are included in a potential risk management alternative.

For scenarios where non-breach risk is the primary contributor to total flood risk, non-structural measures or raising the levee will likely be the
most effective way to address flood risk in the levee area. Conversely, for scenarios where levee risk is the primary contributor to flood risk,
structural remediation focused on the risk driving failure modes, combined with non-structural consequence management measures, will likely be the
most effective way to reduce risk.

### Levee Risk

The Levee Risk tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-207" />) of the Results Module displays the information necessary to plot results on the f-N chart
at the bottom of the page. Including:

1. Expected Annual consequence (Life Loss or Property Damage) for each failure mode (EALL or EAD).

1. Annual Probability of Failure (APF). The APF represents the likelihood, in any given year, that a levee will fail for the identified failure mode.
   APF is plotted on the y-axis of the f-N chart for each failure mode.

1. Average Consequence (Life Loss or Damage). The average consequence is the probability weighted average consequence for a given failure mode. It is
   computed by dividing the Expected Annual consequence by the APF. Average consequence is plotted on the x-axis of the f-N chart for each failure mode.

Results displayed on the Levee Risk tab for individual failure modes are based on the marginal system response curves, which means they will differ
slightly from those on the Annual Probability and Expected Annual tabs. These estimates provide a simple and consistent means to identify actionable
failure modes independent of the impact of other failure modes. However, the expected annual consequence and APF results for Levee Risk at the bottom
of the table are the sum of the competing risk adjusted values.

### Flood Risk

The final tab in the Results Module is the Flood Risk tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-208" />). Similar to the Expected Annual tab, the Flood Risk
tab provides a visual representation of the contribution of levee risk compared to non-breach risk for the overall flood risk behind the levee. The
results are displayed on the f-N chart. Flood risk expected annual consequence and APF is the sum of levee risk and non-breach risk. Average
consequence (life loss or damage) is the expected annual consequence divided by APF.
