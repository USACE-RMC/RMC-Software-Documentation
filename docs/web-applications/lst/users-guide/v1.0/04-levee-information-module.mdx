# Levee Information Module

## Purpose of this module

The LST Levee Information module provides information about the levee segment and the screening. It is comprised of four areas: NLS information,
Segment Information, Screening Information, and Levee Images. The Levee Information module also has a map window. The Levee information module screen
is viewable in <FigReference figKey="figure-21" />.

<strong>The NLD and the LST</strong>: The LST pulls data necessary to support the screening effort for each segment from the National Levee Database
(NLD). This includes data on the Levee Information tab such as items in the Segment Information section (e.g. Maximum Height, Crest Width, etc.) as
well all data in the NLD Basic Information section. It also pulls the Leveed Area and Levee System Route from the NLD. The system route line includes
crest profile. If you identify inaccurate NLD data during the screening process, it must be corrected in the NLD and then redownloaded into the LST.
None of the source data can be modified in the LST and pushed back to the NLD. Multiple links are embedded in the LST that provide efficient
navigation to the NLD source data.

Note: Some NLD data fields like the leveed area require an administrator to refresh as it is a large data transfer. The administrator update is
planned to initiate this data sync on a recurring basis to meet user demand. To expedite a data refresh, e-mail the LST helpdesk at
lsthelpdesk@usace.army.mil.

To get to the Levee Information module from the Home page:

1. Click Levee Screenings at the top of the page.

1. Click Search for the Levee Segment or System in the search bar or click “Recently Accessed” to see a list of recently accessed screenings and
   select the system or segment to be screened.

1. Click the Levee Screening ID (LS ID) or the “Edit Screening” icon for the segment to be screened.

If you are working in any other module for the levee you are screening, simply click Levee Information in the LST module navigation bar.

The Levee Information module is comprised of four tabs:

1. NLD Information: Displays key information about the levee segment sourced from the NLD.

1. Segment Information

1. Screening Information

1. Levee Images

## NLD Information

Data in the <em>NLD Information</em> tab is all pulled directly from the NLD and is not editable in the LST. If the screening team identifies any data
that is inaccurate in this section, work with the district NLD manager to revise it in the NLD.

## Segment Information

The Segment information section of the Levee Information Tab includes a mixture of data that is pulled from the National Levee Database (NLD) as well
as those entered by the screening team. Fill out all the fields that are not auto populated from the NLD (Click “Load from NLD” to reload these fields
from the NLD for the active segment). Data from the NLD can be modified in this section if more accurate information is discovered during the
screening process. No changes to the data in this section will be stored back to the NLD, you should coordinate necessary changes with the appropriate
district NLD managers.

The levee geometry data will be used to generate a scaled levee cross section schematic viewable in the Levee Images tab.

The Primary Embankment and Foundation Material and Construction Method text field box is used by users to describe the geological and geotechnical
characteristics of the levee foundation and embankment including any data gaps or uncertainties. Details on the relevant construction methods –
including compaction, etc. – can be described here. The information included in this text field will be used in the segment report.

## Screening Information

The Screening Information tab of the Levee Information module includes the Screening ID and Date that the screening was initiated (not editable). It
also allows you to provide the names of the team members that assisted in the screening effort. All fields must be filled out including questions
related to whether the sponsor was present during the screening and whether the segment being screened connects to a non-project segment.

A <em><strong>non-project segment</strong></em> is segment of man-made high ground not part of the federally authorized project which a levee
system/segment ties into and whose existence and performance is necessary for excluding flood waters from the leveed area. Some examples of these are
roadways, railroads, canals, and other levee embankments. Non-project segments are inventoried, inspected, and assessed if they make up part of the
levee alignment and are necessary for the proper functioning of the levee system.

Enter the names of those that participated in the screening including the Facilitator, Geotech Advisor, Structural Advisor (if applicable), Hydraulics
Advisor, and Consequence Advisor. If the facilitator or any other team member fill multiple roles, enter their name accordingly.

Finally, answer the questions related to whether the sponsor was a participant in the screening and the date the sponsor was notified that the
screening risk assessment was taking place. USACE and levee sponsors work together to understand the benefits and risks associated with levees, build
awareness among the public, fulfill daily responsibilities on levees, and take actions to manage the future performance of the levee. It is important
to reach out to the sponsor prior to starting the screening assessment to encourage their involvement and coordinate scheduling their involvement.
Sponsor involvement is critical to ensure that the most accurate data is included in the screening.

## Levee Images

Supporting images for the levee segment should be added in the Levee Images tab (<FigReference figKey="figure-24" />). One image of a typical levee
section with loading percentage is generated automatically to help visualize the levee cross section to scale. Users may upload additional photos,
figures, and drawings of important levee features (e.g. typical levee section, as-built drawings and maps with labels for important features) that aid
in the understanding of the levee segment. Select “Add Photo” icon at the bottom of the page (<FigReference figKey="figure-25" />). Typical
recommended images and figures are listed under the “Select Photo Type” dropdown. Users will add captions to explain the image and its relevance to
the screening. These images and captions are included in the segment report.

Note: images that help justify performance ratings for a specific failure mode should be uploaded in the Performance tab for that failure mode.

## Map Viewer

The bottom right section of the Levee Information tab contains the map viewer. The map viewer shows the leveed area and levee system route line as it
is defined in the NLD. Nothing in the map viewer is editable, but the screening team can visualize the various segments that make up the levee system,
and use it to verify the NLD data are correct. The map viewer can also be used to see components of the levee segment including F<em>loodwalls</em>,
<em>Closures</em>, and <em>Pump Stations</em> by turning on those layers or surrounding levee systems by turning on <em>All Systems</em> in the legend
menu.
