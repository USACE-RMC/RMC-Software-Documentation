# Appendix C - Levee Screening Review and Approval

## Levee Screening Quality and Consistency

The Levee screening process and results provide a basis for understanding the flood risk associated with the levee system. Participants in the risk
assessment gain valuable knowledge through development of the screening itself, but the value of the results is increased when risk screenings are
developed consistently across the entire portfolio of levees. Consistency in the engineering input allows for direct comparison of risk drivers across
 the portfolio and therefore allows for risk-informed investment decisions.

## Levee Screening Review

Levee Screenings performed in the Levee Screening Tool proceed through a full review process that is directly integrated into the LST website itself.
  The process includes steps for Local Quality Control Review, National Consistency Review, Opportunities for High Level Portfolio Manager Input, and
Levee Owner Engagement. The specific steps from screening initiation to final approval of levee screenings within the LST are described in this
document.

## Levee Screening Review Roles

The following roles for individuals are key to progressing through the approval process.

- <strong>Facilitator</strong> –Team Lead for individual screenings

- <strong>1st Tier Reviewer</strong> – Primary Local Review & Acceptance of Screening

  - USACE-Specific: District Levee Safety Program Managers (LSPMs) are 1<sup>st</sup> Tier Reviewers

- <strong>2nd Tier Reviewer</strong> - Review Screenings in Area of Responsibility

  - USACE-Specific: District Levee Safety Officers (LSOs) are 2<sup>nd</sup> Tier Reviewers

- <strong>3rd Tier Reviewer</strong> - Review Screenings in Area of Responsibility

  - USACE-Specific: Division LSPMs are 3<sup>rd</sup> Tier Reviewers

- <strong>Senior Oversight Group </strong>- Responsible for National Consistency and Recommend Risk Characterization

- <strong>National Review Cadre</strong> - Delegated Responsibility from LSOG to provide National Consistency & Quality Assurance Reviews

- <strong>Headquarters</strong> –Post-LSOG Approval of Levee Screenings

## Levee Portfolios per NLD Responsible Organization

The Levee Screening Tool is very closely linked with data from the National Levee Database. Specifically, for the LST screening creation and review
process, the NLD Responsible Organization field for each levee system controls access for individuals to create, edit and review specific screenings.

National Roles & Organization-based roles associated with LST Accounts for are summarized in the table below.

Note that for organizational based roles, there may be more than one user account with each role for the organization. Only one of the individuals is
required to act for the required approval steps.

## Approval Process Steps

The LST approval process includes 6 steps for approval from Submittal to final Confirmed status, some of which are notifications to high level
portfolio managers for awareness and an opportunity to offer review comments. Also note that Levee Screenings are created and reviewed on a
full-system basis, and all segments progress together through the approval process.

### 1st Tier Review

Primary Quality Control review of the screening at the local level. This review serves as the District Quality Control (DQC) within USACE.

### National Review

First line of Quality Assurance and National Consistency Review. This review is performed by the National Review Cadre for Levee Screenings. This
review serves as the Agency Technical Review (ATR) within USACE.

### 1-2-3 Confirmed

Review of screening by High Level Portfolio Managers after National Consistency Review is complete. Approval of the screening by 1<sup>st</sup> Tier,
2<sup>nd</sup> Tier, and 3<sup>rd</sup> Tier reviewers is required before the screening advances to SOG review. These concurrent reviews serve as
District and Division Quality Assurance reviews within USACE.

### SOG Review

Senior Oversight review for National Consistency and recommendation of Risk Characterization.

### Headquarters Approval

Headquarters evaluation and sign-off on SOG recommendations.

### Confirmation

After Headquarters Approval, 2<sup>nd</sup> Tier Reviewer confirms the results of the screening. This is the final step before results are published
to the public facing National Levee Database. It also provides an opportunity for a request for reconsideration if the Levee Owner or 2<sup>nd</sup>
Tier disagrees with the results.

## Review Action Interface

The review actions are access through the LST Levee Screenings tab. The individual (or role) that has the next approval action is clearly indicated in
 the ‘ball-in-court’ box below the review progress graphic. This box can be clicked to access the approval action window.

The approval action window options are unique depending on the phase of review and the role of the individual.

## Review Comment Interface

Review comments can be entered in the Levee Screening Tool for each levee segment within the levee system. The interface for comment entry is the
Review tab located within the levee screening view.  Comments can be entered, responded to, and closed independently of the screening review status.

## Risk Characterization

The National Cadre & Levee Senior Oversight Group each are prompted to enter recommended Levee System Action Classification and justification language
 upon approval on the screening. These fields are entered with the Review Action Window. Each levee segment in the system received a unique LSAC &
justification.

The overall system LSAC is computed as the lowest LSAC (highest risk) segment in the system. The LSOG recommendation for LSAC is used for publishing
to the NLD after final confirmation of the screening.

Note that levee segments that are not inspected receive an abbreviated screening knows as a “no-access screening” and the segment will receive a “no
verdict” LSAC. LSAC for the overall levee system when a no-access screening is included will computed as normal, but receive a special designation to
indicate the missing segments (e.g. 2*, 3*, 4*).
