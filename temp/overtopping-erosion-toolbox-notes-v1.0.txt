Post-Processing Physically Based Model Results
Using the RMC Overtopping Erosion Toolbox
23 October 2023
About
The Risk Management Center (RMC) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
has developed a suite of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to support risk assessments for
dam and levee safety. Each analysis suite is composed of multiple toolboxes (Microsoft
Excel workbooks), and each toolbox contains multiple spreadsheet tools or calculation
worksheets (Microsoft Excel worksheets).
The Physically Based Breach Model worksheet in this toolbox deterministically and
probabilistically assess the likelihood of embankment breach from overtopping erosion
using physically based model results (such as WinDAM C) and user-specified erodibility
parameters for the embankment.
The information from these spreadsheet tools, along with other pertinent information,
informs judgment when developing a list of more and less likely factors and estimating
probabilities. USACE best practice for estimating probabilities is to use the best
available and multiple methods, but all final probabilities are estimated using team
elicitation based on the totality and strength of the evidence.
The RMC continuously works to improve the performance of RMC software; report
possible bugs directly to the RMC at the address listed below. Ideally, report suspected
errors in written form with a description of the problem and the steps that lead to its
occurrence. Suggestions for improvement are also welcomed.

Overtopping Evaluation Process using WinDAM C
To inform the evaluation of embankment overtopping performance (i.e., likelihood of
failure given the loading), a table (or matrix) of conditional probability of failure (i.e.,
system response probability, SRP) as a function of erodibility coefficient (kd) and
undrained shear strength (su) is constructed using WinDAM C. For efficiency, critical
shear stress (c) is typically conservatively assumed to be zero, and the other input
parameters are modeled as discrete variables.
If the selected combination of kd and su result in a breach initiation time greater than
zero in WinDAM C (i.e., headcut breaches upstream crest regardless of breach size), a
value of 1 is entered in the table. Otherwise, a value of 0 for no failure/breach is entered
1

in the table. Users typically quickly get a feel for where failure occurs to focus their
efforts and efficiently populate the matrix.
The process is repeated for a series of hydrographs that are scaled so that the peak
stage corresponds to the peak overtopping depths of interest (e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 ft,
etc.) to fully assess the system response. The end-product of this phase of the
evaluation is a series of system response matrices corresponding to the peak
overtopping depths of interest. A generic example is shown below.

The toolbox performs a probabilistic analysis using 1,000 iterations. Values of kd and su
are randomly sampled based on a user-specified triangular distribution. The toolbox
assumes kd and su have a -1.0 correlation (perfectly negative). This will be conservative.
Although not required to perform a probabilistic analysis, Palisade @RISK software
(standalone version or as part of the Palisade DecisionTools Suite) can customize the
probabilistic analysis. If a probabilistic analysis is selected using @RISK to customize
the probabilistic analysis, the minimum, most likely, and maximum values are input, and
an @RISK formula for a triangular distribution is used as a default. However, a valid
@RISK distribution can be input in lieu of this default formula. The correlation matrix
named “Corr” must be added to the end of the user-specified input distributions for kd
and su using the @RISK RiskCorrmat property function. Use RiskCorrmat(Corr,1) for kd
and RiskCorrmat(Corr,2) for su.
A user-defined function (UDF) performs two-way linear interpolation to obtain the SRP
for each iteration (kd-su pair). The iteration results are tabulated, and the average SRP
value is calculated as shown in the generic figure below.
