RMC Internal Erosion Suite

1. Introduction
The Risk Management Center (RMC) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed a
suite of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to support risk assessments for dam and levee safety. Each analysis
suite is composed of multiple toolboxes (Microsoft Excel workbooks), and each toolbox contains multiple
spreadsheet tools or calculation worksheets (Microsoft Excel worksheets). The RMC Filter Evaluation
(Continuation) Toolbox is part of the RMC Internal Erosion Suite.
The information from these spreadsheet tools, along with other pertinent information, informs judgment
when developing a list of more and less likely factors and estimating probabilities. USACE best practice
for estimating probabilities is to use the best available and multiple methods, but all final probabilities are
estimated using team elicitation based on the totality and strength of the evidence.
The RMC continuously works to improve the performance of RMC software; report possible bugs
directly to the RMC at the address listed below. Ideally, report suspected errors in written form with a
description of the problem and the steps that lead to its occurrence. Suggestions for improvement are also
welcomed.

3. General Overview
3.1.

Getting Started

Copy or download the toolbox file to the computer. To open the toolbox file, either:
•

Find the file on the computer and double-click it. This opens the file in Microsoft Excel.

•

Open Microsoft Excel and use the application to open the file: Once Microsoft Excel is open, go to
the File menu at the top of the window and select Open.

The toolbox is an Excel binary workbook (.xlsb) that uses macros. You may need to enable the macros,
either before opening the file or by clicking “Enable Content” in the yellow Security Warning message
bar with a shield icon that appears after the file is opened. The actual message in the message bar will
vary depending on the computer’s settings and installed add-ins. Figure 1 displays examples of different
wordings that may appear in the message bar.

Figure 1. Security warning message bars with the “Enable Content” option to enable macros.

3.2.

Organization

Although the toolbox does not provide a calculation cover sheet, adding one is strongly recommended. A
calculation cover sheet captures project information, a description and purpose of the calculation, the
assumptions for critical input parameters, a summary of the major conclusion and results, and a revision
history.
Each toolbox has a similar appearance and organizational structure:
•

The first worksheet, About, summarizes the purpose of the toolbox and gives contact information for
the RMC software development team.

•

The second worksheet, Terms and Conditions, contains the terms and conditions for use of the
toolbox (IWR software).

•

The third worksheet, Version History, contains the revision history. Semantic versioning is used in
the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
−

MAJOR – significant worksheet changes not compatible with previous versions.

−

MINOR – additional features or enhancements that do not fundamentally change the calculations.

−

PATCH – backward-compatible bug fixes.

•

The fourth worksheet, References, lists the references cited for each calculation worksheet.

The workbook and worksheets are not protected to prevent unwanted changes. However, because the
toolbox has user-defined functions (UDFs) and subroutines in Visual Basic, you cannot directly copy
worksheets to another workbook without potentially losing functionality. A note in a bold red font at the
upper right margin indicates if the selected worksheet includes such features.
At the top of each calculation worksheet, input information for the preparer and checker for quality
control (QC) documentation and the calculation title in case multiple copies of the worksheet are created
for different analysis scenarios (Figure 2). The footer of each calculation worksheet contains the version
number, which can be cross-referenced with the revision history on the third worksheet.

User-specified input includes values and selections from drop-down lists. User input cells are light
yellow, and these cells are unprotected. When cells use drop-down lists, a note in blue font in the right
margin of the row alerts the user to use the drop-down list. Conditional formatting applies a gray
background to cells that are not based on a user selection. When a user-specified value or calculated value
is outside of acceptable ranges, the cell is orange to indicate caution to the user.
All units for user-specified input values are clearly labeled. Most user-specified input values use English
units. However, values may be in metric where metric units are more common in practice (e.g., particle
size in millimeters or permeability in centimeters per second). The toolbox may convert English units to
metric units to perform some calculations or if required for a specific formula based on the reference
material for the equation.
If the calculation worksheet is a function of headwater level, up to seven headwater and tailwater levels
may be specified at the top of the worksheet. Tailwater may be required to calculate the net hydraulic
head and hydraulic gradient. Specify the elevation datum by selecting one of three options from the dropdown list: ft-NAVD88, ft-NGVD29, and Other. The two datum selections include English units of length
(feet). If Other is selected, provide a user-specified datum along with feet (e.g., ft-MSL [Mean Sea
Level]). Figure 3 through Figure 5 illustrate the three possible scenarios.

Most calculation worksheets break down complex analysis into computational steps following a logical
sequence (Figure 6). Some simpler worksheets do not have steps. Generally, different methodologies are
unique worksheets. Some worksheets may include multiple methodologies, which are labeled as options
(Figure 7).
Step 1: Select the method of analysis

Figure 6. Example of step banner.

Figure 7. Example of option banner.
Some calculation worksheets can perform either a deterministic or probabilistic analysis. Although not
required to perform a probabilistic analysis, Palisade @RISK software (standalone version or as part of
the Palisade DecisionTools Suite) can customize the probabilistic analysis. A note appears in a bold red
font at the upper right-hand margin of a calculation worksheet indicating if this feature is included with
the toolbox.
User notes generally appear in the right margin of each calculation worksheet. Some notes are in blue or
red font for heightened awareness. These notes include references to source materials for equations,
figures, tables, pages, etc. If the RMC modified the source material, the reference citation says “adapted
from” instead of “from.”
Tabular and/or graphical summaries are generally the primary output of the toolbox. The UDFs in the
PlotScale module change the minimum and maximum values of the x-axis and y-axis for charts. If the
calculation worksheet is a function of headwater level, you can define up to five headwater levels of
interest and plot them as vertical reference lines. By selecting the chart and then selecting the Filter icon
to display the filter pane, you can choose which data series to display. This is useful when computing the
results from multiple methodologies, but not all are applicable or desired to display.

RMC Internal Erosion Suite

4. Background
Once erosion initiates, it continues unless the eroding forces are reduced or migrating eroded particles are
impeded. Continuation is the phase of internal erosion where the relationship of the particle-size
distribution between the base soil (core) and the filters or adjacent materials controls whether erosion will
continue.
Filters are designed to prevent particle movement from intergranular seepage flow where defects are
present in a base soil or seepage water flows through pore spaces of a soil mass in an embankment or
foundation. A properly designed filter prevents movement of base soils by seepage forces at a discharge
face. The filter supports the discharge face such that bridging between closely spaced contact points
prevents any movement of base soil particles into the filter. The filter is also sufficiently coarse to allow
seepage water to escape freely. Figure 8 illustrates how the filter, in contact with the soil discharge face,
supports and prevents soil movement.

Figure 8. Schematic of filter providing particle retention (FEMA 2011).
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (2011) defines a filter as a soil gradation that
meets both particle retention and drainage criteria. The term drain refers to a soil gradation that is
typically a second stage to the first-stage filter and conveys larger amounts of seepage. This toolbox
assesses the particle retention and permeability criteria of filters to inform the likelihood of continuation
of erosion. The procedures for evaluating particle retention can be for single-stage and multi-stage filters.

USACE Dam and Levee Safety Programs

RMC Filter Evaluation (Continuation) Toolbox
RMC Internal Erosion Suite
For multi-stage filters, repeat the procedure for each zone boundary progressing from the finest to the
coarsest-grained filter material.
In their published literature, Terzaghi and Sherard used a lowercase “d” to represent the particle size
(diameter) of the base soil and an uppercase “D” for the particle size (diameter) of the filter material. This
nomenclature is still commonly used but can be confusing when designing or evaluating two-stage filters
since the filter from the first stage becomes the base for the second stage. Therefore, the toolbox uses the
following nomenclature:
•

DXXY, where D = particle size (diameter)

•

XX = percentage passing by weight of particles finer than D

•

Y = material designation (either B = base, F = first-stage filter, E = second-stage envelope, or other
drainage element).

5. Filter Gradation
This worksheet performs a particle-size analysis of the filter material.

5.1.

Filter Gradation

The input includes sieve size (inches or sieve number), particle size (mm) for hydrometer analysis, and
percent finer (by weight) for representative coarse and fine gradations of the filter material.
Use the drop-down list to select the sieve size that defines the gradation of the filter material. Coarse sieve
designations range from 12 inches to 0.25 inch, and standard sieve designations range from No. 3½ to No.
200. The particle size (D) in millimeters is automatically populated if a sieve size is selected. If a
hydrometer (sedimentation) analysis was performed on the fine-grained portion of the filter material (i.e.,
passing the No. 200 sieve), select “Hydrometer” from the drop-down list for sieve size, and input
user-specified particle sizes. Particle sizes from sieve or hydrometer analysis must be in descending order.
The user-specified percent finer (by weight) for the filter material gradation (F) is the percentage of
material passing each sieve size or percentage of particles finer than the diameter given by Stokes’ Law
for hydrometer analysis. The input must be a decimal number consisting of a whole number and a
fractional part (e.g., 100.0 for 100.0 percent passing, 25.5 for 25.5 percent passing). Cells that do not
apply or do not require user-specified input have a gray background. Figure 9 is an example of the
gradation input.

Figure 9. Filter Gradation worksheet: Gradation input.

RMC Filter Evaluation (Continuation) Toolbox
RMC Internal Erosion Suite
Figure 10 is an example of the summary of the particle-size analysis for the user-specified gradations. The
gravel percentage (including coarse and fine gravel percentages), sand percentage (including coarse,
medium, and fine sand percentages), fines content (FC) (including estimated silt and clay percentages),
coefficient of uniformity (Cu) and coefficient of curvature (Cc) for the coarsest and finest filter material
are calculated according to the Unified Soil Classification System (American Society of Testing and
Materials [ASTM] D2487). An average percentage is also calculated.
The coefficient of uniformity (Cu) is calculated as in Equation 1.
𝐶𝑢 =

𝐷60
𝐷10

(1)

where:
D10 = particle-size diameter corresponding to 10 percent passing on the cumulative
particle-size distribution curve
D60 = particle-size diameter corresponding to 60 percent passing on the cumulative
particle-size distribution curve
The coefficient of curvature (Cc) is calculated as in Equation 2.
(𝐷 )2

𝐶𝑐 = 𝐷 30𝐷

10 60

(2)

where:
D30 = particle-size diameter corresponding to 30 percent passing on the cumulative
particle-size distribution curve
If a gradation does not specify the particle size corresponding to 10 percent passing, 30 percent passing,
or 60 percent passing, Cu and Cc are not calculated.

Filter Gradation After Segregation or Washout

The filter material may be susceptible to segregation or internal instability. Segregation is the tendency of
large particles in a given mass of aggregate to gather together when the material is loaded, transported, or
otherwise disturbed.
Segregation can cause pockets of coarse zones that may not be filter-compatible with the material being
protected. FEMA (2011) provides filter design guidance to limit segregation potential based on the
maximum D90F and the minimum D10F. This segregation criteria consider only the design gradation, and
the potential for segregation during storing, hauling, dumping, spreading, and compacting must also be
considered, which is more subjective and relies on indirect evidence such as construction photographs.
Internal instability describes the loss of soil particles because of seepage. Finer particles in the soil can
move within the soil mass under the forces imposed on the particles by seepage flow. Gap-graded or
broadly graded soils are examples of internally unstable soils. The RMC Internal Instability Toolbox
assesses the susceptibility of the filter material to internal instability. Soils which are susceptible to
internal instability are also susceptible to segregation.
Segregation and internal instability result in a coarser filter. Figure 11 illustrates an event tree node that
can be added to explicitly consider the likelihood of the filter being segregated or internally unstable
during a risk assessment. The particle retention evaluation must consider two gradations of the filter
material. Perform the first evaluation using the original or stable gradation and perform the second
evaluation using the adjusted gradation after segregation or washout of the erodible finer fraction.

This worksheet performs a particle-size analysis of the original base soil gradation and, if necessary, the
regraded base soil.

Base Soil Gradation

In step 1, the gradation input and particle-size analysis for the base soil is the same as the filter material
detailed.

Needs Assessment for Regrading

Sherard and Dunnigan (1989) developed the concept of a mathematical adjustment or regrading the base
soil to a maximum particle size of 4.75 mm (100 percent passing the No. 4 sieve) for soils with gravels
and to correct for broadly graded soils. Broadly graded soils can be internally unstable, where the finer
particles can move internally within a matrix of larger particles, and regrading corrects for this
phenomenon. Permitting the inclusion of gravel within a base soil gradation leads to a large D85B and
subsequently, a large D15F. Since gravel particles do not have any particle retention capability in broadly
graded soils, the resulting filter gradation is too coarse to provide particle retention of the finer fraction of
the base soil.
Step 2 performs a needs assessment for regrading the base soil using a series of questions about various
base soil characteristics. Use the drop-down list to assess whether the base soil is gap-graded, because a
visual examination of the shape of the gradation curve and judgment are required. Base soils containing
particles larger than the No. 4 sieve, having FC less than 15 percent, and being broadly graded are
evaluated based on the particle-size analysis in step 1. Broadly graded soils are defined by ASTM D2487
as having 1 ≤ Cc ≤ 3 and having Cu ≥ 6 for sands or Cu ≥ 4 for gravels. The evaluation of broadly graded
soils may be inconclusive if Cu and Cc are not calculated because D10B or D30B are not available, for
example. For that scenario, manually extrapolate the gradation curve and externally calculate Cu and Cc.
Use the drop-down list for the final assessment for whether the base soil is broadly graded. Figure 12 is
an example of the responses to the questions about conditions informing regrading.

Figure 12. Step 2 of Base Gradation worksheet: Conditions informing regrading.
Based on the responses to the questions, the needs assessment evaluation sequence is as follows:
1.

If the base soil is gap-graded, it must be regraded on the particle size (closest sieve) that is missing.

If the base soil does not contain particles larger than the No. 4 sieve, regrading is not necessary.

3.

If the base soil contains particles larger than the No. 4 sieve, it must be regraded to 100 percent
passing the No. 4 sieve, unless it has FC less than 15 percent and is not broadly graded.

Figure 13 is an example of the summary of the needs assessment results.

Base Soil Gradation After Regrading

In step 3, the method of computational regrading is based on the results in step 2. If regrading is not
required, “N/A” displays. If the base soil is gap-graded, use the drop-down list to select the sieve size
closest to the upper size where the gradation curve has a point of inflection, and the corresponding
particle size displays. Cells that do not apply have a gray background. A particle size of 4.75 mm displays
if regrading on the No. 4 sieve is required. Figure 14 through Figure 16 illustrate the three possible
scenarios.

If regrading is required, the base soil is regraded to the appropriate maximum particle size. For Regrade
the base soil to 100 percent passing the No. 4 sieve, the percentage passing each sieve size of the original
base soil is divided by the percentage passing the No. 4 sieve of the original base soil, multiplied by 100
percent, as shown in Figure 17. The procedure for regrading a gap-graded base soil is the same, except to
regrade on the particle size that is missing instead of the No. 4 sieve.

7. Design for Particle Retention
Modern filter design criteria for particle retention are based on providing a no-erosion condition. The
no-erosion condition occurs when a filter material is sufficiently fine to seal with no erosion, or
practically no erosion, of the base material. This worksheet assesses the particle retention criterion for no
erosion and helps to screen potential failure modes if no erosion is expected. If a filter fails the no-erosion
screening, the other erosion boundaries using the Foster and Fell (2001) method described in section 8 are
evaluated to assess how much erosion is required for self-filtering to occur and whether it can be
tolerated.

7.1.

Base Soil Characterization

Step 1 characterizes the base soil. The fines content (FC), or percent passing the No. 200 sieve size by
weight, of the finest base soil after regrading (if applicable) is obtained from the Base Gradation
worksheet, where it is interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent
passing. The base soil category (BSC) is assigned based on the FC of the finest base soil after regrading
(if applicable). Use the drop-down list to select whether the base soil is non-dispersive or dispersive.
Figure 19 is an example of step 1.

Figure 19. Step 1 of Particle Retention worksheet: Base soil characterization.

Filter Material Characterization

Step 2 characterizes the filter material. The coarsest D15F is obtained from the Filter Gradation worksheet,
where it is interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent passing.
Figure 20 is an example of step 2.

7.3.

Particle Retention Criterion

Sherard et al. (1984) and Foster and Fell (2000) show that the measurable property of the filter that best
defines its particle retention capability is the D15 of the filter (D15F). Research also shows that the
correlation between D15F and the d85 of the base soil being protected by the filter (D85B) provides the best
correlation for successful particle retention.
Sherard and Dunnigan (1985) developed the No-Erosion Filter (NEF) test to find the ratio of D15F and
D85B that establishes a no-erosion condition for non-dispersive base soils. Additional research by Foster
and Fell (2001) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) helped in developing the no-erosion
condition for dispersive base soils. The results of the NEF and UNSW tests were used to develop the
modern filter design criteria for particle retention in FEMA (2011).
Step 3 evaluates the no-erosion particle retention criterion by comparing the coarsest D15F to the
maximum allowable D15F based on the BSC and knowing whether the base soil is non-dispersive or
dispersive. The criteria are a function of D85B and FC, as shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22. If the
coarsest D15F is less than or equal to the maximum allowable D15F, “Meets” displays next to the
calculation. If the criterion is not met, “Fails” displays next to the calculation. A green background
displays if the particle retention criterion is met, and an orange background displays if the particle
retention criterion is not met.
Based on the particle retention criterion, a statement appears after the calculations indicating if the filter
material satisfies the no-erosion particle retention criterion or is too coarse to satisfy the no-erosion
particle retention criterion. If the particle retention criterion for no erosion is not met, use the Foster and
Fell (2001) method to further evaluate the effectiveness of the filter material for particle retention. Figure
21 and Figure 22 are examples of the two possible scenarios for the no-erosion particle retention criterion.

8. Foster and Fell
Many existing embankment dams have filter or transition zones coarser than required by modern filter
design criteria. Foster and Fell (2001) indicated that filter materials could be coarser than those resulting
from the no-erosion particle retention criterion but still prevent continuous erosion of the base material.
For risk assessments of existing embankment dams, it is necessary to evaluate the likelihood of
continuation of erosion when such filters are present.
Foster and Fell (2001) developed the continuing erosion filter (CEF) test by modifying the NEF test to
evaluate filter performance in terms of how much erosion is required to seal the filter material. The
concept of erosion boundaries was developed to describe the filter behavior.
•

No-erosion (NE) condition occurs when the filter material seals with no erosion or very little erosion
of the base material. The increase in leakage flows is so small that it is likely undetectable. Filters
designed and constructed according to modern filter design criteria satisfy the NE condition as
described in section 7.

•

Some erosion (SE) condition occurs when “some” erosion of the base soil occurs, but the filter
quickly seals after particles of the base material clog the surface of the filter.

•

Excessive erosion (EE) condition occurs when “excessive” erosion of the base soil occurs, allowing
large increases in leakage flow before the filter seals. The extent of erosion is sufficient to damage the
embankment.

•

Continuing erosion (CE) occurs when the filter is too coarse to allow the eroded base materials to seal
the filter, allowing unrestricted or continuous erosion of the base soil and leakage flows.

Figure 23 conceptually shows these erosion boundaries from CEF test behavior.

Figure 23. Conceptual erosion boundaries of continuing erosion filter test behavior
(adapted from Foster and Fell 2001).

Applying these methods correctly requires understanding the context from which each method was
developed, as laboratory test conditions may vary from field conditions. The filter evaluation relies
heavily on the research of Foster and Fell (2001) to determine NE, SE, EE, and CE boundaries for the
base soil. These erosion conditions were derived from CEF tests, which consisted of a vertically
downward flow regime using very high water pressures (i.e., full tap pressure of 300 kPa) and a
preformed hole. Therefore, the results are likely conservative.

8.1.

Base Soil Characterization

Step 1 characterizes the base soil after regrading (if applicable). Due to the large variability of base soil
gradations that may be encountered in practice, gradation test data may include statistical results that are
not representative of in situ conditions. FEMA (2011) discusses selecting the representative base soil
gradation, and the RMC Soil Classification Toolbox can be used to plot all base soil gradations to help the
evaluation. While the range or envelope of base soil gradations are input on the Base Gradation
worksheet, use the drop-down list to specify the percentage (N) of those gradations considered
representative of the base soil gradation for subsequent calculations.
For each input sieve size, the range or envelope of the corresponding percent finer is proportioned to
obtain the finer (100% − N)∕2 of the base soil gradations and the coarser (100% − N)∕2 of the base soil
gradations. The average gradation is also obtained for each input sieve size for the range or envelope of
the corresponding percent finer. Alternatively, input the representative base soil gradation directly on the
Base Gradation worksheet and use a value of 100 percent for N, so no further adjustment is made. Fell et
al. (2008) recommended selecting representative gradations of the regraded base soil (if applicable),
which are indicative of the finer 5 percent of base soil gradations, average gradation, and coarser 5
percent of base soil gradations (i.e., the representative base soil gradation represents N = 90 percent of all
gradation tests). Selecting the representative base soil gradation is illustrated in Figure 24.

Figure 24. Example of representative gradation curves.

RMC Filter Evaluation (Continuation) Toolbox
RMC Internal Erosion Suite
The D95B, D90B, D85B, FC, and fine-to-medium sand content (fm) of the representative base soil gradation
are interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent passing. For the
Foster and Fell (2001) method, the fine-to-medium sand content of the base soil is defined as the
percentage between 1.18 mm and 0.075 mm, whereas ASTM D2487 defines fine-to-medium sand as the
percentage of soil particles between 2.00 mm and 0.075 mm. Use the drop-down list to select whether the
base soil is non-dispersive or dispersive. Figure 25 is an example of step 1.

Figure 25. Step 1 of Foster and Fell worksheet: Base soil characterization.

8.2.

Filter Material Characterization

Step 2 characterizes the filter material. The range of D95F is obtained from the Filter Gradation
worksheet, where it is interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent
passing. Figure 26 is an example of step 2.

No-Erosion Boundary

Step 3 evaluates the no-erosion boundary [(D15F)NE] for the representative base soil gradations after
regrading (if applicable), based on the BSC and whether the base soil is non-dispersive or dispersive. The
criteria are the same as the no-erosion criteria on the Particle Retention worksheet and are a function of
D85B and FC as shown in Figure 27.

Step 4 evaluates the continuing erosion boundary [(D15F)CE] from Foster and Fell (2001) for the
representative base soil gradations after regrading (if applicable), based on D95B using the criterion shown
in Figure 28. If a continuing erosion condition is met for the representative base soil gradation, the other
erosion boundary is not assessed.

and whether the base soil is non-dispersive or dispersive, using the criteria shown in Figure 29. The

Likelihood of Erosion

Step 6 compares the erosion boundaries for the representative base soil gradation after regrading (if
applicable) against the range of D15F (example provided in Figure 31). The ranges of the erosion
boundaries for the coarse base soil gradation, average base soil gradation, and fine base soil gradation
display as green, blue, and red horizontal lines, respectively. The range for the CE and NE categories
extends infinitely beyond their respective boundaries. The erosion boundaries for each representative base
soil gradation display as short vertical lines of the same color as the horizontal lines, and the erosion
categories are labeled between the boundaries. The range of D15F displays as vertical black lines that
intersect these erosion categories.
The proportions of the filter material gradation that fall into the CE, EE, and SE categories are calculated
for each of the representative base soil gradations after regrading (if applicable) and are summarized in a
table. It is possible for the EE boundary to be the same as the CE boundary. For those scenarios, there is
no proportion for EE, and only SE displays. The sum of the proportions must be 100 percent. Fell et al.
(2008) recommended estimating the proportions for CE, EE, and SE and then calculating the proportion
of the filter material gradation finer than the NE category as in Equations 3, 4, and 5.

If the range of D15F does not fall into the CE category (i.e., the gradation of the filter material is finer than

suggested a procedure to account for the possibility of the gradations being coarser than indicated by the
available information, which depends on how much finer the gradations are than the CE boundary. In this
procedure, the minimum PCE is based on the ratio of the coarsest D15F to the (D15F)CE. Intermediate

10. Constricted Exit
Constricted, or non-erodible, exits consist of open joints, defects, or cracks in conduits, drains, walls, or
rock. For erosion to continue, the opening size must be sufficient for the adjacent base soil particles to
pass through it. This worksheet assesses the joint/defect opening size that allows erosion to continue.

10.1. Base Soil Characterization
Step 1 characterizes the base material. The range of D95B of the base soil adjacent to the open joint,
defect, or crack is obtained from the Base Gradation worksheet, where the finest and coarsest D95B of the
adjacent base soil after regrading (if applicable) are interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size
and linear scale for percent passing. Figure 35 is an example of step 1.

Figure 35. Step 1 of Constricted Exit worksheet: Base soil characterization.

10.2. Open Joint, Defect, or Crack Characterization
Step 2 characterizes the open joint, defect, or crack, and the joint/defect opening size (JOS) is input. The
user-specified JOS and range of D95B of the adjacent base soil are portrayed on a cumulative particle-size
plot to visually compare their relative sizes, as shown in Figure 36. The y-axis (percent passing by
weight) is truncated at 90 percent passing since only the particle-size diameter corresponding to 95
percent passing is used in the evaluation. The size of the open joint, defect, or crack is depicted with a
vertical back line at the JOS and horizontal lines that extend infinitely smaller since a logarithmic scale is
used. The range of D95B displays as a red horizontal line.

10.3. Likelihood of Continuation
Step 3 estimates the probability of continuing erosion (PCE) using the procedure of Fell and Foster (2023).
The JOS that allows continuing erosion of the adjacent base soil (JOSCE) is between D95B and 3D95B.
Sherard et al. (1984) concluded that uniform filters act similar to laboratory sieves with an opening sieve
size approximately equal to D15F∕9. The D95B criterion assumes the Foster and Fell (2001) continuing
erosion criterion (see section 8.4) applies to erosion into an open joint, defect, or crack, and the crack
width is equivalent to the filter opening size of the voids between the particles in a filter. The 3D95B
criterion is based on the JOS for cement grout to penetrate and flow along the opening of joints in rock.
The probabilities shown in Table 2 considered these limits. In the table, PCE is a function the ratio of the
JOS to the finest D95B of the adjacent base soil after regrading (if applicable). If JOS∕D95B is less than
0.4, zero is displayed. If JOS∕D95B is greater than or equal to 0.4 and less than 0.5, “<0.0001” is
displayed. Intermediate values between 0.5 and 3.0 are interpolated using a z-variate scale for probability
and a linear scale for the ratio JOS∕D95B.

According to Fell and Foster (2023), these probabilities apply to erosion into open defects in the
foundation and conduits or walls with steady flow conditions. Use higher probabilities for erosion into
open defects in conduits or walls with dynamic flow conditions.
If the coarsest D95B of the adjacent base soil after regrading is less than or equal to the JOS (coarsest D95B
≤ JOS), the proportion of the D95B finer than the JOS is 100 percent. If the finest D95B of the adjacent
base soil after regrading is greater than or equal to the JOS (finest D95B ≥ JOS), the proportion of the D95B
finer than the JOS is 0 percent. If the coarsest D95B of the adjacent base soil after regrading (if applicable)
is greater than the JOS and the finest D95B after regrading (if applicable) is less than the JOS, the
proportion of the D95B finer than the JOS is calculated as in Equation 6. Figure 38 is an example of step 3.

According to Fell and Foster (2023), Table 2 applies to erosion into open defects in the foundation and
conduits or walls with steady flow conditions. Use higher probabilities for erosion into open defects in
conduits or walls with dynamic flow conditions
If coarsest D95B after regrading (if applicable) ≤ JOS, proportion of D95B finer than JOS is 100 percent.
If coarsest D95B after regrading (if applicable) > JOS and finest D95B after regrading (if applicable) < JOS,
proportion of D95B finer than JOS is

log10 (JOS) − log10 (finest D95 B)
x100%
log10 (coarsest D95 B) − log10 (finest D95 B)

If finest D95B after regrading (if applicable) ≥ JOS, proportion of D95B finer than JOS is 0 percent.

Note: Probabilities obtained from this method should not be used directly in risk assessments.
Rather, the values should be used to help develop a list of more and less likely factors.

11. Permeability
This worksheet assesses whether the filter material meets the drainage criterion for permeability. It
requires no user-specified input. Permeability is directly proportional to the square of the effective
particle size with all other factors being equal. Typically, the permeability of a filter should be at least 16
to 25 times that of the base material. This criterion is generally met if D15F is larger than 4 to 5 times
D15B. In some very broadly graded base soils, this requirement may be difficult to meet.

11.1. Base Soil Characterization
Step 1 characterizes the base soil. FEMA (2011) indicates the coarsest D15B before regrading is used to
evaluate permeability requirements. Step 1 obtains the coarsest D15B before regrading from the Base
Gradation worksheet, where it is interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale
for percent passing. Figure 39 is an example of step 1.

11.2. Filter Material Characterization
Step 2 characterizes the filter material. The finest D15F is obtained from the Filter Gradation worksheet,
where it is interpolated using a logarithmic scale for particle size and linear scale for percent passing.
Figure 40 is an example of step 2.

11.3. Permeability Criterion
The criterion for permeability is that the filter material has a minimum D15F that is an integer multiplier
of the coarsest D15B before regrading but not less than 0.1 mm. USACE Engineer Manual (EM) 1110-21901 (2005) requires a multiplier of 3 to 5. However, USBR (2011) and National Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) (2017) require a multiplier of 5, which is considered the primary criterion on this
worksheet. The minimum D15F of the filter material is calculated as in Equation 7.

where:
D15F = particle-size diameter of the filter material corresponding to 15 percent passing on
the cumulative particle-size distribution curve
D15B = particle-size diameter of the base soil corresponding to 15 percent passing on the
cumulative particle-size distribution curve before regrading
Step 3 evaluates the permeability criterion for integer multipliers ranging from 3 to 5. If the criterion is
met, “Meets” displays next to the calculation. If the criterion is not met, “Fails” displays next to the
calculation. A green background displays if the criterion is met, and an orange background displays if the
criterion is not met. Based on the primary criterion using a multiplier of 5, a statement appears after the
set of calculations indicating whether the filter material is sufficiently permeable to perform the required
drainage function. Examples of the two possible scenarios for the primary filter criterion are shown in
Figure 41 and Figure 42.
